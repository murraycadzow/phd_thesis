In this chapter I investigate regions of the genome that exhibit signatures of selection in Polynesian populations with a particular focus on loci associated with serum urate levels and metabolic conditions.

<!-- Part of this work was originally published in @Cadzow2016 but I have updated the selection analysis to make use of a new dataset that became available after publication. The selection analyses are in this chapter. -->


## Introduction

<!-- Much of the early work in looking at selection was focused at the gene level [@Wright1951;@Fisher] and the methods that were developed were intended for few loci, or limited sequence from a single region [@ref;@ref;@ref]. This was largely due to the high cost and limited availability of whole genome chip or sequence data. It wasn't until after the completion of the human genome project in 2001 and the advent of 'next generation sequencing' where the cost of full genome data rapidly dropped and there became an abundance of whole genome sequence data [@ref]. -->
At the turn of the millennium the draft reference human genome was released [@Lander2001]. Following from this, there were a few large projects to characterise human variation and diversity. The first project was the HapMap project [@Hapmap2005] and was based on \gls{snp} array data. This was followed by the 1000 Genomes Project [@1KGP2010; @1KGP2012; @1KGP2015snp] which was the first large project to be based on whole-genome (re)sequence data. Alongside these variation projects were a few projects that aimed to focus on the genomic diversity of humans, such as the Human Genome Diversity Project [@Cann2002; @Rosenburg2002], and later the Simons Genome Diversity Project [@Mallick2016]. 

Over the last decade there has been a steady flow of studies on genome-wide selection [@voight2006map; @sabeti2006positive; @Coop2009; @tang2007new; @pickrell2009signals; @Grossman2010]. The main population samples for this have been part of the 1000 Genomes Project, which sampled over 2500 individuals for full genome (re)sequencing from five 'super' population groups [@1KGP2015snp]. The five super populations cover each of the geographical regions of Africa, Europe, East Asia, South Asia, and the Americas. This dataset, while capturing a large representation of the human population variation, does not have representation for the populations of Polynesia. 


### Positive selection

### Selection in Polynesian populations

Projects to capture the genetic diversity of humans have sampled populations worldwide, but outside the populations sampled by the 1000 Genomes Project, the population sample sizes have been small [@Cann2002; @Rosenburg2002; @Mallick2016]. Past studies that have included Oceanic populations have had minimal representation of Polynesian populations, e.g. @Kimura2008 only had 24 Tongan individuals. The latest project for human diversity, the Simons Human Diversity Project, did include the New Zealand M$\bar{a}$ori but they were only represented by a single individual and did not feature in many of the analyses [@Mallick2016].

More recently there have been studies that have looked at selection in Polynesian populations but with a focus on a few candidate loci, not at a genome-wide scale [@Myles2011; @Cadzow2016; @Minster2016]. The main feature of these studies has been the investigation of 'thrifty genes'.

#### Thrifty Gene Hypothesis

The "Thrifty genotype hypothesis" was originally hypothesised by @Neel1962, whereby it was posed that due to the differences between individuals with or diabetes that how could a disease that should have strong selection against it continue to have high prevalence if there was not some genetic advantage [@Neel1962]. In the Polynesian context, this hypothesis has been invoked in an attempt to explain the higher prevalence of metabolic related diseases such as \gls{t2d} and obesity [@Myles2011; @Minster2016]. However, there are several refutations of the thrifty genotype for Polynesian populations as being 'just-so' stories [@Cadzow2016; @Gosling2014; @Gosling2015]. An alternatice to the 'thrifty-gene' hypothesis is that the link between metabolic diseases and the innate immune system, susceptibilty of populations to metabolic disease might be due to selective pressure from infectious disease, such as malaria [@Gosling2015]. Uricase, the enzyme for metabolising urate, was lost through multiple mutations - a reduction in promoter activity followed by two further loss of function mutations and occurred before the divergence of humans from the great apes [@Kratzer2014]. The evolutionary history of uricase however has also been described as "the original thrifty-gene" [@Kratzer2014].

### Selection in urate and gout

The benefits of urate include the its ability to increase blood pressure and it is thought to have helped with early hominins to stand upright [@Watanabe2002] and increase blood flow to the brain. Serum urate is also a potent anti-oxidant which accounts for >50% of the anti-oxidant activity of the blood [@Glantzounis2005; @Parmar2009]. Mono-sodium urate crystals that form in conditions of elevated urate are a potent adjuvant for the immune system and enhance the immune response, providing a protective effect against cancer due to the turnover of cells [@Ames1981]. Uric acid has also been identified as being an important part of the malarial response, contributing to cytokine secretion and response of dendritic and T-cells [@GallegoDelgado2014].

<!-- - Possible reasons for the loss @Alvares-Lario2010 -->
<!--     - urate helps raise bp, this would have been beneficial in low salt environments, helped early hominins stand @Wantannabe? -->
<!--     - increases blood flow to the brain -->
<!--     - potent anti-oxidant which accounts for > 50% of the bloods anti-oxidant activity [refs 26,27 alvares-lario2010] -->
<!--     - crystals enhance local immune response - protective against cancer due to the turnover of cells? -->

<!-- ?? The fructose response for leads to insulin desensitivity @Johnston2007? -->
<!--     - fructose blocks glyconeogeneis -> increased glycogen storage -->

An increased level of urate in the blood is called \gls{hu} and is causal of gout. The prevalence of \gls{hu} in Polynesian populations is higher than many other populations [@Gosling2014], and with it are higher prevalences of the co-morbidities of gout, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, kidney disease, and \gls{cvd} [@Winnard2013]. In New Zealand, gout prevalence is ~3.1%, however, prevalence in M$\bar{a}$ori and Pacific peoples is 6-8% with 40% of individuals with gout also having diabetes or \gls{cvd} [@Winnard2013]. Gout is an immune response to the monosodium urate crystals that are formed from the precipitation of urate from the blood and \gls{hu} is a prerequisite for the formation of these crystals [@Merriman2011a].

<!-- \Gls{hu} in the Pacific is seen in Eastern and Western Polynesia, but the prevalence in the ancestral populations of Near and Remote Oceania is reduced. However, Taiwanese aboriginals also have the higher prevalence of \gls{hu} [@Gosling2014]. -->

\Gls{hu} has two main components: over production of urate, and under excretion. Over production is influenced by diet, such as high purine or fructose content, or under genetic control. Under excretion is the main cause of \gls{hu}, caused by either increased reabsorption or decreased secretion. The kidneys are the organ where the majority of secretion and excretion of urate is performed, with about 90% being reabsorbed [@Kutzing2008]. In the proximal tubule, on the apical membrane, the urate transporters of URAT1, OAT4, and SLC2A9 reabsorb urate, whereas ABCC4, NPT4, and NPT1 are responsible for secretion [@Mandal2015]. On the basolateral membrane, OAT1-3, increase intracellular uric acid, but SLC2A9 moves uric acid from intracellular to extracellular [@Mandal2015]. The ATP powered transporter ABCG2 is responsible for excretion of urate in the gut and there are \gls{snp}s that lead to a reduction of function in ABCG2 in Western Polynesians  [@Phipps-Green2010]. Together the genes _SLC2A9_ and _ABCG2_ account for 3.4% of the genetic variability of urate [@Kottgen2013].

From previous studies there is prior evidence of selection at urate associated loci [@Zhang2013a; @Grossman2013; @Ramos2017]. In the review from @Ramos2017 on natural selection in rheumatic disease, one of the main loci for gout, _SLC2A9_, in the \gls{yri} population had evidence. The region of _BCAS3_ and _NACA2_ also had evidence, originally found by @Grossman2013 in the Asian population from the HapMap project data. @Zhang2013a had evidence for the associated loci of _ATXN2_ (rs653178) and _RREB1_ (rs675209)  having undergone selection when using a F~ST~-based method. The co-morbidities of \gls{hu} also have evidence of selection, with loci associated with \gls{t2d} having been found to have evidence of having undergone selection [@pickrell2009signals; @voight2006map; @Grossman2010, @Grossman2013]. Most recently a Samoan specific variant in _CREBRF_ that is protective for \gls{t2d} but causal for obesity has also been identified as having evidence of selection in the Samoan population [@Minster2016].

<!--
motivation: seemed to be little in the way of calculating stats genome wide and wasn't sure how sensitive these stats were to snp density

This chapter is about trying to first of all establish how sensitive the various statistics were to window/slide variation

from the literature there doesn't seem to be any recommendation as to how to compute these statistics genome wide. Up until recently the various statistics were computed at the 'feature' level, usually the gene.

Fst has a paper in early 2000's from Bruce Weir that touched on what sort of size to use howver it largely just came down to 'this window size seems to have enough of a smoothing effect as well as display some of the variation in the data' type approach and was largely just based on a this looks good enough.

Pybus et al specified their window sizes which was roughly 30 kb window and 3kb slide for most statistics however this was decided on unshown data as a trade off between resolution and density.

In cadzow 2014 I tried had tried a few sizes and it it seemed that there was little difference between them other than the smaller the window the more noisy the data looked.

While I was playing around with this for Tajima's D there does seem to be at least some relation to the density of the snps and the window size, which does intuitively make sense, in that if there are none or only 1 snp per window then the stats are going to be pretty poor.

From the core exome work it looks as though 30 kb was ok and at least when the distribution of TD was binned by number of snps per window it didn't look to bad and the overall total distribution of TD looks not too bad. Increasing from 30 kb didn't really change TD that much. the extremes become more extreme but the means increaseas window size increases.
-->

<!-- ascertainment bias will skew selection statistics that are site frequency spectrum dependant in chip data due to the over-representation of intermediate frequency SNPs, these include Tajima's D (upward) and Fay and Wu's H [@Clark2005]


Carlson2005 did windows of 100kb, slide 10kb and mean snps were ~50/window. ascertainment bias esp in the +ve end. continous region on >20 windows where 75% were in bottom 1% was defined as contiguous regions of Tajimas D reduction.
Rafajlović2014 largely followed Carlson2005, they also discarded windows with less than 5 snps.

Bigman2010 has a custom Tajima's D that is created to be similar to iHS in terms of calculation
-->



### Objectives

- Investigate regions that are under selection in the Polynesian populations
- Investigate regions previously associated with urate, \gls{t2d}, obesity, kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome for signatures of selection

## Methods

The selection of individuals, and preliminary data preparation for the selection data set is detailed in Section \@ref(selectionDataset). It consisted of combining 500 individuals (100 per population for each of \gls{nzm}, \gls{cim}, \gls{sam}, \gls{ton}, and \gls{nzc}) from the Genetics of Gout in Aotearoa study, who had been genoypted on the Illumina CoreExome v24 \gls{snp} array with 2504 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. 

<!-- The selection and neutrality statistics were calculated for individuals populations using a combination of two main software packages, PopGenome in R, and selectionTools v1.1. PopGenome was used to calculate the intra population frequency spectrum based tests for selection and neutrality. Haplotypic stats of \gls{ihs}, \gls{nsl}, and \gls{xpehh} were calculated using the selectionTools pipeline with significance set as being the 99th percentile for the absolute normalised score. Frequency based statistics were also generated such as \gls{daf} and F~ST~. -->

### Calculation of Selection and Neutrality Statistics


<!--
Similar to @Pybus2014, @Rafajlovic2014 and @Carlson2005 a trade off between increasing the number of \gls{snp}s per window and adequate resolution was made and the window size of 100 kb and slide of 10 kb was chosen.
-->
The R package PopGenome v2.2.3 [@Pfeifer2014] was used to calculate the site-frequency spectrum statistics \gls{td}, \gls{fwh}, \gls{fld}, \gls{flf}, \gls{ze}, and F~ST~ over non-overlapping windows of 10 kb (see section \@ref(popgenomeMethods) for further details). Except for F~ST~, the empirical distribution for each population was used to create an upper and  a lower significance threshold. The lower threshold was the 1st percentile and less than zero. The upper significance threshold was the 99th percentile and greater than zero. 
<!-- explain the condition better -->
The greater or less than zero condition was to enable the interpretation of the selection and neutrality statistic results. Contiguous regions of score reduction or elevation were created using a rolling window approach, whereby a condition of 15 or more windows out of a minimum of 20 consecutive 10 kb windows were required to have met a significance threshold in the same tail of the distribution.

The calculation of \gls{ihs}, \gls{nsl}, and \gls{xpehh} were calculated and normalised using selscan v1.1.0b [@Szpiech2014] as part of the selectionTools 1.1 [@Cadzow2014] pipeline as detailed in section \@ref(selectionTools). The default setting was used which was a maximum gap extension of 200 kb. Significance was defined as |value| > 2.6 which was equivalent to the most extreme ~1% of values after normalisation using frequency bins of 0.05.


### Pathway enrichment analysis

Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by taking genes that intersected the 1st percentile windows for the \glsdesc{sfs}-based statistics that also had a value < 0, or genes that had a significant marker for \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} and inputting them into Enrichr ^[http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/ accessed 22 November 2017] [@Chen2013b; @Kuleshov2016] and exporting the KEGG 2016 pathway table.

## Results

fdr_low_tab <- fdr_low %>% 
  filter(lowest_quant == lower_per, super_pop == 'POL') %>% 
  arrange(stat, pop) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(stat, pop, FDR, lowerCI, upperCI, lowest_quant)

fdr_high_tab <- fdr_high %>% 
  filter(highest_quant == upper_per, super_pop == 'POL') %>%

  select(stat, pop, FDR , lowerCI, upperCI, highest_quant)
```

<!-- > This paragraph needs to do a brief overview and general talk about how there was an overall pattern for the SFS stats and link out to the stat specific stuff -->

Results will be split into two themes, the first will be regions of the genome that show evidence of selection in the Polynesian populations, the second will be focusing specifically on selection of urate and associated loci in Polynesian populations. For reporting there will be a focus on the 1^st^ percentile/lower tail for the intra-population statistics as this is the distribution end that can correspond with positive selection.

For the frequency spectrum-based intra-population statistics of \gls{td}, \gls{fwh}, \gls{fld}, \gls{flf}, and \gls{ze} there were population-specific distributions. There was similarity however between the populations within a super population. The Polynesian populations in general had a left shifted distribution and had the lowest means, medians, and 1^st^ percentiles compared to the other super population groups (Table \@ref(tab:superGlobalSummary)). Within a super population there were similar numbers of windows that were in the 1^st^ percentile and < 0, but across super populations the number of windows differed (Table \@ref(tab:numSigWindows)). Some examples of this were the \gls{afr} populations for \gls{td}, \gls{fld}, and \gls{flf} in the lower tail, had as little as 30% the number of windows that met the lower threshold than the other populations. The Western Polynesian and \gls{eas} populations had up to 50% less windows for \gls{ze} than the  populations of \gls{afr}, \gls{amr}, and \gls{eur}. The Polynesian populations had fewer significant \gls{snp} for \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} than the other populations. These observations were the basis of the investigation that formed Chapter \@ref(clustering).

```
In order to control for false positives the \gls{fdr} was calculated for \gls{td}, \gls{fld}, \gls{flf}, \gls{fwh}, and \gls{ze}. To calculate the \gls{fdr}, 5000 permutations were generated, each randomly shuffling the genotypes of markers by marker position (i.e. shuffling rows only). For each permutation, for each statistic, the values for quantiles 'bins' were calculated for both tails of the distribution. The 'bins' ranged from 0.01 to 0.1% at 0.01 increments, 0.1 to 1% at 0.1% increments, 1 to 5% at 1% increments, and 10%. The median and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the values of the quantile 'bins' across the permutations (i.e. the median, 2.5^th^ and 97.5^th^ percentiles for the values of the 1^st^ percentile bin from all permutations). The enrichment for each quantile bin was then calculated by comparing the number of windows that were observed in the data compared to the number expected from the permutations. \Gls{fdr} was then estimated by using the value for the 1^st^ or 99^th^ percentile and finding the nearest conservative quantile bin using the median, that was either larger for the lower tail, or smaller for the upper tail and taking the inverse of enrichment for the bin (Table \@ref(tab:fdrpol)). This estimate will be conservative compared to the true \gls{fdr}.

The \gls{fdr} for \gls{ze} was 1.0 for all Polynesian populations in the lower end of the distribution and the 1st percentile of the data fell within the 2nd percentile bin from the permutations. Whereas, for \gls{td} and \gls{fwh} the quantile bin was `r fdr_low_tab %>%filter(stat %in% c('Tajima.D','Fay.Wu.H')) %>% summarise(min(lowest_quant))`%, with the maximum upper confidence interval being `r fdr_low_tab %>%filter(stat %in% c('Tajima.D','Fay.Wu.H')) %>% summarise(three_dp(max(upperCI)))`. For the purpose of reporting on individual statistics, a threshold of 0.1 was applied, to reduce the expected false positive rate to be less than 1 in 10 on average. \Gls{fld}, \gls{flf}, and \gls{ze} all had an \gls{fdr} above this threshold for the Polynesian populations and will be reported on only as additional evidence when they overlap with other results or were a region of consecutively depressed score.

The selection and neutrality statistics that were in the 1^st^ percentile and < 0 were compared to regions and genes identified in @Hider2013 for \gls{eas} and @Jonnalagadda2017 for \gls{sas} as these papers had used a similar, but not identical methodology to identify regions under selection. @Hider2013 investigated selection in the East Asian populations (\gls{chb}, \gls{chs}, and \gls{jpt}) of the 1000 genomes project in the Phase 1 release. For this they used a non-overlapping window size of 25kb and excluded windows with less than 10 segregating sites and then looked at the top 1% of results. They reported regions that were significant for \gls{td}, \gls{fwh}, \gls{fld}, \gls{flf}, and \gls{ihs}. Comparing the regions from @Hider2013 with regions that met the significance threshold for this project there were 118 of 206 regions for \gls{td}, 15 of 151 for \gls{fwh}, 65 of 261 for \gls{fld}, 83 of 255 for \gls{flf}, and 5 of 85 for \gls{ihs}.

Of the genes reported in @Jonnalagadda2017, there were 2 of 5 for \gls{td}, 0 of 5 for \gls{fwh}, and 2 of 5 for \gls{ihs} that were also significant in this project. @Jonnalagadda2017 used the same window set up as @Hider2013, but used the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 release for the \gls{gih} and \gls{itu} populations. 

> define these regions

In conjunction with the studies from @Hider2013 and @Jonnalagadda2017, @Ramos2017 looked at evidence of selection in rheumatic disease, including gout, using the \gls{ihs} results from @voight2006map from the HapMap phase II dataset. There were three populations used which were Asian, European, and African. The equivalent populations of \gls{chb} and \gls{jpt} were used to represent to the Asian population, \gls{ceu} for European, and \gls{yri} for African, and unknown was any of the specified populations, from the 1000 genomes individuals when comparing the loci reported in @Ramos2017 with the \gls{ihs} results. Loci reported for European had  `r (sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == 'CEU', genename %in% ramos[['ceu']])%>% mutate(pop = 'CEU', statname = case_when(statid == 20 ~ "nSL", statid == 26 ~ "iHS"), chrom = paste0('chr',chrom)) %>%  select(SYMBOL = genename, chrom, statname) %>% distinct() %>% NROW() / length(ramos[["ceu"]] ) *100) %>% round_dp(., 1)`% overlap with \gls{ceu}. The Asian reported loci matched `r (sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == 'JPT' | pop == 'CHB', genename %in% ramos[['asi']])%>% mutate(pop = 'ASI', statname = case_when(statid == 20 ~ "nSL", statid == 26 ~ "iHS"), chrom = paste0('chr',chrom)) %>%  select(SYMBOL = genename, chrom, statname) %>% distinct() %>% NROW() / length(ramos[["asi"]] )*100) %>% round_dp(., 1)`% with \gls{chb} and \gls{jpt}, and for African there was `r (sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == 'YRI', genename %in% ramos[['yri']])%>% mutate(pop = 'YRI', statname = case_when(statid == 20 ~ "nSL", statid == 26 ~ "iHS"), chrom = paste0('chr',chrom)) %>%  select(SYMBOL = genename, chrom, statname) %>% distinct() %>% NROW() / length(ramos[["yri"]] ) *100) %>% round_dp(., 1)`% of the reported loci also found in \gls{yri}. For the loci reported with an "unknown"" population, `r (sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop %in% c('CEU','YRI','JPT','CHB' ), genename %in% ramos[['ceu']])%>% mutate(pop = 'ceu_yri_asi', statname = case_when(statid == 21 ~ "nSL", statid == 27 ~ "iHS"), chrom = paste0('chr',chrom)) %>%  select(SYMBOL = genename, chrom, statname) %>% distinct() %>% NROW() / length(ramos[["unknown"]] )*100) %>% round_dp(.,1)`% were found to match in any of \gls{ceu}, \gls{yri}, \gls{chb}, or \gls{jpt}.

The differences in regions being found as significant can be partially attributed to the differing window sizes, and the difference between sequence and chip based genotyping for @Hider2013 and @Jonnalagadda2017 and difference in markers for @Ramos2017.

A gene list derived from @voight2006map Table 1 was created to include genes that showed evidence of selection across different combinations of the populations \gls{ceu}, \gls{chb}, \gls{chs}, \gls{jpt}, and \gls{yri}. All genes except _SPAG4_ were positive for significant \gls{ihs} markers in the appropriate populations they were originally reported in (Table \@ref(tab:voightTab)).

XXX CHECK XXX

When using the significant loci of \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} as a filter on the significant xpehh loci, there were 2 genes that had a significant ihs or nsl value in only Polynesian populations populations that were also significant for XPEHH with Polynesian populations. These genes were _ATP8B2_ and _IFNGR1_.

The \gls{t2d} associated gene, _ATP8B2_, had 4 markers that were significant: rs6702754, rs11586379, rs2988721, and rs200305485. With rs6702754 being the marker with the most number of significant results for _ATP8B2_. Rs200305485 was only significant between the Western and Eastern Polynesian populations. The \gls{ton} population had a significant \gls{xpehh} with the Eastern Polynesian populations of \gls{cim} and \gls{nzm}, and also with all of the \gls{eas} populations of \gls{cdx}, \gls{chb}, \gls{chs}, \gls{khv}, \gls{jpt}, and the \gls{sas} population of \gls{beb}. The \gls{sam} population only had a significant \gls{xpehh} with a subset of the populations that \gls{ton} did. These were \gls{nzm}, \gls{chs}, and \gls{cdx}.  

_IFNGR1_ was from the obesity associated gene list, and only the \gls{nzm} population had both a significant \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}, and significant \gls{xpehh}. There were two markers that were significant for \gls{xpehh} with \gls{nzm} and \gls{asw}, rs1887415 and rs9376267.

### Selection in Polynesian Populations
<!--
This section is about reporting how a population went, maybe add in a general comparison of the 1000 genomes populations, eg average number of genes specific to a population

The general format that I want for this section is to get:
- the genes that were reported in multiple stats as significant
- genes that were only reported in a particular population
- runs of depressed regions (eg 75% of >20 windows) that were significant in a row
- pathway/ontology terms
-->

There were `r genelists %>% NROW()` genes that were associated with urate and metabolic diseases from the \gls{gwas} catalog (see Table \@ref(tab:gwascatref) for references), with `r bind_rows(sig_ihs_val, sig_nsl_val) %>% select(pop, SYMBOL = genename) %>% bind_rows(., lower_sig_stats %>% select(pop, SYMBOL)) %>% filter(SYMBOL %in% genelists$genename, pop %in% poly_pop) %>% select(SYMBOL) %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` having at least a single window or \gls{snp} meeting a threshold for a single statistic in the Polynesian populations. Genes reported here were highlighted based on three criteria: a significant haplotypic result in multiple Polynesian populations, or having multiple statistics meeting the significance threshold in at least a single Polynesian population, or the locus only having the main significant result in Polynesian populations, with minimal signal in other populations, i.e. multiple significant markers in Polynesian populations and one or two in other populations.

In this subsection results will be presented first for those that were in common between all Polynesian populations and the sub-groups of East and West Polynesia. Following this the results for individual Polynesian populations will be presented.  A complete table of all genes that had results meeting the various thresholds for the various statistics used can be found in Table \@ref(tab:intrasfsPol).

Each Polynesian population had a similar number of windows in the 1st percentile, except for the Western Polynesian populations with \gls{ze} where they had up to ~50% less (Table \@ref(tab:sfsWindowsTable)).
The Eastern Polynesian populations tended to have more independent non-consecutive regions and number of genes that were intersected by windows than the Western Polynesian populations. However, this did not translate into a higher number of genes that were significant in only a single population. There were similar numbers of genes that intersected the windows that met the significance threshold in either distribution tail between the Polynesian populations of \gls{cim}, \gls{nzm}, \gls{sam}, and \gls{ton}.

Out of all the genes that met significance, the Polynesian super population had the fewest genes unique to a super population (Figure \@ref(fig:superUpset)). The upset plot shows number of genes that were in common between super populations that had both intra-populational haplotypic and \gls{sfs} evidence. There were 117 genes that only had evidence of selection in Polynesian populations, and 12 genes that had evidence in all super populations.

The number of genes that had at least one marker that was significant in the haplotypic tests, and one window that intersected the same gene that was in the 1st percentile for a frequency based statistic and were shared between all of the Polynesian populations was `r length(intersect(intersect(extract_sig("CIM"), extract_sig("NZM")), intersect(extract_sig("SAM"), extract_sig("TON"))))` (Figure \@ref(fig:polyUpset)). The number of genes in common between the Eastern Polynesian populations that had both intra-populational haplotypic and \gls{sfs} evidences was `r length(intersect(extract_sig("CIM"), extract_sig("NZM")))`. There was about 30% more genes for the same criteria in the Western Polynesians, with `r length(intersect(extract_sig("SAM"), extract_sig("TON")))` genes. Between the individual Polynesian populations, roughly one third of the genes that were significant in a population were not in common with the other Polynesian populations. The \gls{nzm} population had the most genes (395) that were not shared with any of the other Polynesian populations.

##### Prevously reported Polynesian "thrifty-genes"

There was no signal of selection for the previously reported 'thrifty genes' of _PPARGC1A_ and _CREBRF_ [@Myles2011; @Minster2016]. There were no markers or windows that met the significance thresholds for any of the neutrality and selection statistics. This was consistent with the results of @Cadzow2016 for _PPARGC1A_. The two identified \gls{snp}s for \gls{bmi} in Samoans at _CREBRF_, rs12513649 and rs373863828 [@Minster2016] were both absent from the CoreExome chip. While there was no selection signal from \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} at _CREBRF_ (chr5:172483355-172566291), downstream at chr5:172,800,000-173,000,000 there were four markers for \gls{sam} and seven for \gls{ton} that were significant for \gls{ihs}. At the same location for \gls{nsl} there were six significant markers for \gls{sam} and seven for \gls{ton}. The populations from the \gls{eas} super population had fewer significant markers for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}. The significant markers at this location in \gls{sam} were consistent with @Minster2016, were intergenic, and intersected the long intergenic non-coding RNA, _CTB-164N12.1_.

##### Genes with possible selection in Polynesian populations

A complete list of all of the genes that had windows in the 1st percentile and values < 0 for the Polynesian populations can be found in table \@ref(tab:intrasfsPol). A complete list of genes that had significant \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} in Polynesian populations can be found in Tables \@ref(tab:ihsPolgenes), \@ref(tab:nslPolgenes), and \@ref(tab:xpehhPolgenes).

The left histogram shows the total number of genes  with both haplotypic and frequency spectrum-based evidence for each super population. The top histogram is the number of genes that were in common between the super populations. The dots indicate the particular set of super populations for the intersection.

There were `r sig_ihs_val %>% anti_join(., sig_ihs_val %>% filter(!pop %in% poly_pop), by = c('genename')) %>% select(pop, genename) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% filter( n == 4) %>% NROW()` genes (_ANO1-AS1_, _CCDC180_, _COL6A3_, _ESPNL_, _GRIP1_, _LINC00661_, _LINC01006_, _NPAT_, _NPFFR1_, and _PPA1_) that all Polynesian populations and no other super populations had at least one \gls{snp} with a significant \gls{ihs} marker, and there were `r sig_ihs_val %>% anti_join(., sig_ihs_val %>% filter(!pop %in% poly_pop), by = c('genename')) %>% select(pop, genename) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% filter(n > 0) %>% NROW()` genes that at least one Polynesian population and no other super populations had. The Eastern Polynesian populations had `r sig_ihs_val %>% anti_join(., sig_ihs_val %>% filter(!(pop %in% c("SAM","TON"))), by = c('genename')) %>% select(pop, genename) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% filter(n > 0) %>% NROW()` genes, similarly, the Western Polynesian populations had `r sig_ihs_val %>% anti_join(., sig_ihs_val %>% filter( !(pop %in% c("CIM","NZM"))), by = c('genename')) %>% select(pop, genename) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% filter(n > 0) %>% NROW()` genes. This compared to the significant \gls{nsl} markers where there were `r sig_nsl_val %>% anti_join(., sig_nsl_val %>% filter(!pop %in% poly_pop), by = c('genename'))  %>% select(pop, genename) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% filter( n == 4) %>% NROW()` genes, that had at least one significant marker, and were found in only all four Polynesian populations. Within only Eastern Polynesian populations, there were `r sig_nsl_val %>% anti_join(., sig_nsl_val %>% filter(!pop %in% c("SAM","TON")), by = c('genename')) %>% select(pop, genename) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% filter(n > 0) %>% NROW()` genes that had a significant marker, and within the Western Polynesian populations, there were `r sig_nsl_val %>% anti_join(., sig_nsl_val %>% filter(!pop %in% c("CIM","NZM")), by = c('genename')) %>% select(pop, genename) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% filter(n > 0) %>% NROW()` genes only significant in that group. When the intersection of Polynesian specific genes for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} was compared, the number of genes in common was `r inner_join(sig_ihs_val %>% anti_join(., sig_ihs_val %>% filter(!pop %in% poly_pop), by = c('genename')) %>% filter(pop %in% poly_pop) %>% select(pop, genename) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% filter( n == 4), sig_nsl_val %>% anti_join(., sig_nsl_val %>% filter(!pop %in% poly_pop), by = c('genename')) %>% filter(pop %in% poly_pop) %>% select(pop, genename) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% filter( n == 4), by = 'genename') %>% NROW()` that had at least one \gls{snp} in only the four Polynesian populations. These were _GRIP1_ and _LINC00661_. 

##### Selection in genes associated with urate and metabolic disease

Figure \@ref(fig:intraSelGenes) shows the genes associated with urate, gout and related diseases that had a significant marker with either \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} and also had a significant window from a site-frequency spectrum based statistic in at least one Polynesian population. There are only 12 genes that met this criteria. The \gls{t2d} associated gene, _PTPRD_, was the only gene that met the mentioned criteria that had significant markers from all Polynesian populations in \gls{ihs}. The obesity-associated genes _GRID1_, _FHIT_, and _ERBB4_, all had windows from \gls{fwh} that were significant in all Polynesian populations. _ERBB4_ also had significant windows for all Polynesian populations for \gls{td}.

(ref:intraSelGenes) Genes associated with urate, gout, obesity, \gls{t2d}, kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome having both significance in intra-population SFS and haplotypic based methods in at least one Polynesian population. Numbers inside boxes indicate the number of significant windows (\gls{sfs} methods) or \gls{snp}s (haplotypic methods) for the population.

##### Pathway enrichment of genome-wide selection results

Pathway terms from the pathway enrichment analysis using the Enrichr KEGG 2016 table showed there was minimal overlap in the terms that were significant between the Polynesian populations (Table \@ref(tab:keggPath)). There were more pathways in common between the Eastern Polynesian populations than the Western Polynesian populations.

```{r keggPath, results = 'asis'}

##### Regions of haplotypic selection in Polynesian populations

The Polynesian populations had the least number of significant \gls{snp}s for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} (Table \@ref(tab:numSigWindows)).The mean number of significant \gls{snp}s for \gls{ihs} was `r sig_ihs_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% summarise(round_dp(mean(n), 1))` (SD  `r sig_ihs_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% summarise(round_dp(sd(n), 1))`) and `r sig_nsl_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% summarise(round_dp(mean(n), 1))`  (SD `r sig_nsl_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% summarise(round_dp(sd(n), 1))`) for \gls{nsl} (Table \@ref(tab:numSigWindows)). The Polynesian populations had a mean of `r sig_ihs_val %>% group_by(pop,superpop) %>% tally() %>% group_by(superpop) %>% summarise(mn = mean(n)) %>% filter(superpop == 'POL') %>% .[['mn']] %>% sprintf("%.0f",.)` \gls{snp}s with an \gls{ihs} value that was significant, compared to  `r sig_nsl_val %>% group_by(pop,superpop) %>% tally() %>% group_by(superpop) %>% summarise(mn = mean(n)) %>% filter(superpop == 'POL') %>% .[['mn']] %>% sprintf("%.0f",.)` for \gls{nsl}. The minimum number of \gls{snp}s that had a significant \gls{ihs} was `r sig_ihs_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% filter(min(n) == n) %>% .[['n']]` and was from the \gls{`r sig_ihs_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% filter(min(n) == n) %>% .[['pop']] %>% tolower()`} population. For \gls{nsl} this was also \gls{`r sig_nsl_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% filter(min(n) == n)  %>% .[['pop']] %>% tolower`} with `r sig_nsl_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% filter(min(n) == n) %>% .[['n']]` \gls{snp}s. The maximum number of \gls{snp}s was for \gls{`r sig_ihs_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% filter(max(n) == n) %>% .[['pop']] %>% tolower()`} with `r sig_ihs_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% filter(max(n) == n) %>% .[['n']]` for \gls{ihs} and \gls{`r sig_nsl_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% filter(max(n) == n) %>% .[['pop']] %>% tolower()`} with `r sig_nsl_val %>% group_by(pop) %>% tally() %>% ungroup() %>% filter(max(n) == n) %>% .[['n']]` \gls{snp}s. Between significant \gls{snp}s for \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} there was a mean of `r ihs_nsl_sum_tab %>% left_join(., panel %>% select(pop, super_pop) %>% distinct(), by = 'pop') %>% filter(super_pop == 'POL') %>% summarise(round_dp(mean(n), 1))` \gls{snp}s in common for the \gls{pol} populations, `r ihs_nsl_sum_tab %>% left_join(., panel %>% select(pop, super_pop) %>% distinct(), by = 'pop') %>% filter(super_pop == 'EAS') %>% summarise(round_dp(mean(n), 1))` for \gls{eas}, `r ihs_nsl_sum_tab %>% left_join(., panel %>% select(pop, super_pop) %>% distinct(), by = 'pop') %>% filter(super_pop == 'AFR') %>% summarise(round_dp(mean(n), 1))` \gls{afr}, `r ihs_nsl_sum_tab %>% left_join(., panel %>% select(pop, super_pop) %>% distinct(), by = 'pop') %>% filter(super_pop == 'EUR') %>% summarise(round_dp(mean(n), 1))` for \gls{eur}, `r ihs_nsl_sum_tab %>% left_join(., panel %>% select(pop, super_pop) %>% distinct(), by = 'pop') %>% filter(super_pop == 'AMR') %>% summarise(round_dp(mean(n), 1))` for \gls{amr}, and `r ihs_nsl_sum_tab %>% left_join(., panel %>% select(pop, super_pop) %>% distinct(), by = 'pop') %>% filter(super_pop == 'SAS') %>% summarise(round_dp(mean(n), 1))` from \gls{sas}.

```


On average there were `r n_shared_haplo %>% filter(!p2 %in% poly_pop) %>% summarise(mean(ihs)) %>% round(., 1)` \gls{snp}s in common between the Polynesian populations and the other populations for \gls{ihs} and `r n_shared_haplo %>% filter(!p2 %in% poly_pop) %>% summarise(mean(nsl)) %>% round(., 1)` \gls{snp}s for \gls{nsl}. Whereas, there was a higher number of significant \gls{snp}s in common between the Polynesian populations with a mean of `r n_shared_haplo %>% filter(p2 %in% poly_pop, p1 != p2) %>% summarise(mean(ihs)) %>% round(., 1)` for \gls{ihs} and `r n_shared_haplo %>% filter(p2 %in% poly_pop, p1 != p2) %>% summarise(mean(nsl)) %>% round(., 1)` for \gls{nsl} (Table \@ref(tab:nSharedHaplo)). The Eastern/Western Polynesian split was also evident with there being a 2-4 fold difference in the number of \gls{snp}s in common between the Eastern and Western Polynesian populations for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}. There were 24 genes that had at least 1 marker significant across at least 20 populations for all Polynesian populations for \gls{xpehh}. The Eastern Polynesian populations had 28 genes, and the Western Polynesian populations had 49.

##### F~ST~

F~ST~ was calculated in sliding windows of 10 kb across the genome, pair-wise between the Polynesian populations and all other populations. Similar to the results in section \@ref(wholeFst) for the F~ST~ calculated using entire chromosomes at once, the mean F~ST~ using windows had the Polynesian populations most differentiated from the \gls{afr} populations, with a range of mean F~ST~ from 0.148 to 0.203. The Polynesian populations were least differentiated from the \gls{eas} populations with a range of F~ST~ means from 0.051 to 0.076. Between the Polynesian populations the mean F~ST~ ranged from 0.004, between the Western Polynesian populations of \gls{sam} and \gls{ton}, to 0.029 between \gls{nzm} and \gls{sam}. The Eastern Polynesian populations had a marginally higher mean F~ST~ than the Western Polynesian populations at 0.006. The largest maximum F~ST~ of 0.888, across four windows, was between \gls{ton} and \gls{msl} at chr17:62455002-62495001.

##### Pathway enrichment analysis of selected loci in \gls{cim}

<!-- Functional classification of genes with markers that were significant for \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl}, or genes that fell within the windows of the 1st percentile and had a value less than 0 for the frequency spectrum based statistics was done using PantherDB. Only \gls{td} had the main biological process as "Binding", and the second as "Catalytic activity". All other statistics each had "Cellular process" and "Metabolic process" as their first and second largest categories. There were no biological processes that were over represented from the gene list of all genes with possible positive selection. -->

Pathway gene-set enrichment analysis on gene lists for each statistic that met the significance thresholds was done using Enrichr. There was a total of 10 pathways that after multiple testing correction had significant p-values. Nine pathways were significant for the gene list from \gls{nsl} and had a heart and lung focus based on calcium ion movement in the form of genes for calcium transporters and voltage-gated calcium channels. There were five genes related to calcium that were in at least five of the pathway terms: _CACNA1D_, _ADCY9_, _SLC8A1_, _CACNA2D2_, _CACNA2D3._ There was a single pathway that was significant from the genes from the 1st percentile of \gls{td} which was "bacterial invasion of epithelial cells".


##### Consecutive regions of score depression in \gls{cim}

<!-- There were `r consec_lower_regions %>% filter(stat == 'Tajima.D', pop == 'CIM') %>% GenomicRanges::GRanges() %>% GenomicRanges::reduce(ignore.strand = TRUE) %>% length()` regions of consecutive score depression for \gls{td}, `r consec_lower_regions %>% filter(stat == 'Fay.Wu.H', pop == 'CIM') %>% GenomicRanges::GRanges() %>% GenomicRanges::reduce(ignore.strand = TRUE) %>% length()` for \gls{fwh}, `r consec_lower_regions %>% filter(stat == 'Fu.Li.D', pop == 'CIM') %>% GenomicRanges::GRanges() %>% GenomicRanges::reduce(ignore.strand = TRUE) %>% length()` for \gls{fld}, `r consec_lower_regions %>% filter(stat == 'Fu.Li.F', pop == 'CIM') %>% GenomicRanges::GRanges() %>% GenomicRanges::reduce(ignore.strand = TRUE) %>% length()` for \gls{flf}, and `r consec_lower_regions %>% filter(stat == 'Zeng.E', pop == 'CIM') %>% GenomicRanges::GRanges() %>% GenomicRanges::reduce(ignore.strand = TRUE) %>% length()` for \gls{ze}. -->

Looking at regions of consecutively depressed score that also had either a significant \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} marker in them, there were a total of five regions that met this criteria. For \gls{td}, there were two regions. The first, a 290 kb region at chr2:24215002-24505001 covered _FAM228B_ and had a single significant marker for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}. The second, was 470 kb in length at chr11:68105002-68575001, and included _LRP5_ and had a single significant marker for \gls{ihs}. \gls{flf} also had a region that covered _LRP5_ but at chr11:68085002-68355001 and was 270 kb long. For both \gls{flf} and \gls{fld}, there was a 250 kb region at chr16:3545002-3795001 that covered _DNASE1_ with a single marker for \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}, and also _TRAP1_ with two markers each for \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}. \gls{fwh} had a single 250 kb region that covered _MYT1L_ at chr2:2015002-2265001 and had four significant markers for \gls{ihs} and three for \gls{nsl}. 

<!-- There were three regions of consecutively depressed score that intersected obesity associated genes. There was a 240 kb region at chr3:52375002-52615001 that intersected _NT5DC2_ and _PBRM1_ for \gls{fld}. The 250 kb region of chr16:3545002-3795001 intersected  _NLRC3_ for both \gls{fld} and \gls{flf}. And the 310 kb region of chr12:124195002-124505001 intersected _DNAH10_, _ZNF664_, and _CCDC92_ for \gls{flf}. There was a single 280 kb region that intersected the metabolic syndrome associated gene of EDC4 at chr16:67835002-68115001 for \gls{td}. None of the regions that were had consecutively depressed score that intersected genes associated with urate, \gls{t2d}, or kidney disease. -->

##### Selection from haplotypic statistics in \gls{cim}.


Within the most extreme 100 \gls{ihs} values, there were 37 genes. For \gls{nsl} there was 45 genes. Eighteen of these genes were in common, with _C11orf65_, _CNTN4_, _ADAM29_, and _LINC00276_ having at least five significant \gls{snp}s each. The gene with the most significant \gls{snp}s out of any population was _CNTN4_ in \gls{cim} with 27 markers having a significant \gls{ihs} score. The only other population with more than two significant \gls{snp}s was \gls{nzm} with 14. There were four genes represented in the top 100 markers that were associated with obesity or \gls{t2d}, these were: _ADCY9_, _ARL15_, _PSMD6_, and _ZFAND6_. In total there were  `r sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == "CIM") %>% select(genename) %>% anti_join(., sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop != "CIM") %>% select(genename), by = 'genename') %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` genes that were only significant in \gls{cim} for \gls{ihs}, and `r sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop == "CIM") %>% select(genename) %>% anti_join(., sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop !="CIM") %>% select(genename), by = 'genename') %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` for \gls{nsl}. There were 57 genes that had at least 20 populations with significant markers for \gls{xpehh} in only \gls{cim} from the Polynesian populations.  _ARL15_ was associated with obesity and \gls{t2d} [@ref] and _RREB1_ was assoaciated with \gls{t2d} and urate [@ref].

<!-- The gene set over representation analysis using PantherDB had 'cellular component movement' with a fold-enrichment of 4.47 (P = 0.0486) and 'anatomical structure morphogenesis' with fold enrichment of 3.94 (P = 0.0288), as the only significant annotations, when all genes that met a threshold were used.  -->

The pathway gene-set enrichment analysis from Enrichr on the KEGG 2016 pathways had 31 pathways that were significant after multiple testing correction, this was the largest number of pathways out of the Polynesian populations. On average only 9.3% of a pathway was represented by the genes. Thirty were from the significant genes for \gls{nsl}, with many in common with \gls{cim} with calcium transporters and voltage gated calcium channels featuring in many pathways. Compared to the \gls{cim} pathway results, there were more hormone-based pathways that were significant, such as renin secretion, oxytocin signalling pathway, adrenergic signalling in cardiomyocytes, thyroid hormone synthesis, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, insulin secretion, and GnRH signalling pathway. Furthermore, diabetes-related pathways were significant such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin secretion, and pancreatic secretion pathways. The genes that were significant made up about 10% of the genes in the pathways. The genes that were shared in the most pathways included two adenlyate cylases (_ADCY8_ and _ADCY9_), two phospholipase C genes (_PLCB1_ and _PLCB4_), and calcium voltage-gated channel subunits (_CACNA1C_ and _CACNA1D_). Similar to \gls{cim}, there was a single pathway that was significant from the \gls{td} list and that too was for bacterial invasion of epithelial cells.

##### Selection from haplotypic statistics in \gls{nzm}.

From the haplotypic tests for selection (\gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}) there were `r sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == "NZM") %>% select(genename) %>% anti_join(., sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop != "NZM") %>% select(genename), by = 'genename') %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` genes that were only significant in \gls{nzm} for \gls{ihs}, and `r sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop == "NZM") %>% select(genename) %>% anti_join(., sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop != "NZM") %>% select(genename), by = 'genename') %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` for \gls{nsl}. Looking at the genes represented by the most extreme 100 \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} markers there were 30 genes for \gls{ihs}, and 40 genes for \gls{nsl}. There were 12 genes in common between the two sets. _CTNNA3_ had five markers in the top 100 for \gls{ihs}, and was also the gene for \gls{nzm} that had the most overall significant markers for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}. There were 40 genes that had at least 20 populations with significant markers for \gls{xpehh} in only NZM from the Polynesian populations, only one (_PAX5_) of which was associated with obesity [@ref].

 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
q <- xpehh %>%  select(-popid1, -popid2, -posid, -experimentid, -statvalue) %>% filter(pop1 %in% c("CIM","NZM","SAM","TON"), xpehh_value > 0) %>% select(pop1,pop2, genename) %>% distinct() %>% left_join(., panel %>% select(pop2 = pop, super_pop) %>% distinct(), by = 'pop2') %>% group_by(pop1, super_pop, genename) %>% tally() %>% spread(super_pop, n, 0)%>% arrange(genename) %>% mutate(rs = AFR + AMR + EAS + EUR + POL + SAS) %>% filter(rs >=20) %>% select(pop1, genename, rs) %>% spread(pop1, rs) %>% filter(is.na(CIM),!is.na(NZM), is.na(SAM), is.na(TON)) %>% pull(genename)

##### Consecutive regions of score depression in \gls{nzm}

The regions of consecutive depressed score from the 1st percentile of windows  that also contained markers with a significant \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} value covered three regions of the genome for \gls{nzm}. Two of the regions were for \gls{td}, the first was 270kb at chr2:24215002-24485001, and overlapped the region in \gls{cim}. It had a single significant marker for \gls{ihs} in each of _MFSD2B_, _FKBP1B_, and _FAM228B_. The second \gls{td} region was 260 kb at chr4:106555002-106815001 and had a single significant marker for \gls{nsl} in _INTS12_, and a single marker for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} in _SH3RF1_. Another region, a 340 kb region for \gls{fld} at chr2:179325002-179665001 contained a 200 kb region for \gls{flf} at chr2:179395002-179595001. This region also had five significant markers in _TTN-AS1_ for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}

No consecutive regions intersected with genes associated with urate, kidney disease, or \gls{t2d}. There were 2 regions that intersected obesity-associated loci; for \gls{td} a 320 kb region at chr16:67145002-67465001 contained _KCTD19_, and for \gls{flf}, 220 kb at chr16:3555002-3775001 contained _NLRC3_. _EDC4_ which is associated with metabolic syndrome had slightly differing regions that covered it. \gls{td} was 330 kb spanning chr16:67775002-68105001, \gls{fld} was 260 kb spanning chr16:67785002-68045001, and \gls{flf} was 320 kb spanning chr16:67775002-68095001.


Four genes, _CTNNA3_, _RAD51AP2_, _SUPT3H_, and _VSNL1_, had at least one significant marker for \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl}, and also had a window in the 1st percentile from four or more statistics from \gls{td}, \gls{fwh}, \gls{fld}, \gls{flf}, and \gls{ze}.

##### Pathway enrichment analysis of selected loci in \gls{sam}

<!-- - TD main processes: "cellular process", "metabolic process" -->
<!-- - FWH main processes: "cellular process", "metabolic process" -->
<!-- - FLD main processes: "cellular process", "metabolic process" -->
<!-- - FLF main processes: "cellular process", "metabolic process" -->
<!-- - ZE main processes: "cellular process", "metabolic process" -->
<!-- - ihs main processes: "cellular process", "metabolic process" -->
<!-- - nsl main processes: "cellular process", "metabolic process" -->
<!-- - all main processes: "cellular process", "metabolic process" -->
<!-- - all overrepresentation test: nothing -->

<!-- There were no significant results after adjusting for multiple testing when performing the over representation analysis using PantherDB on all genes that had met a significance threshold for any of the intra population selection and neutrality statistics. For all of the intra-population statistics, the main biological functional classification was "cellular process". -->

Only two pathways were significant for the gene-set pathway enrichment analysis using Enrichr. The pathway term "ABC transporters" was significant for gene lists from both \gls{fld} (adjusted P = 0.0190) with 8 of 44 genes and \gls{ihs} (adjusted P = 0.0128) with 9 of 44 genes. The second pathway that was significant was "long-term potentiation" and that was from the \gls{nsl} gene list (adjusted P = 0.0213) with 9 of 66 genes.


##### Selection from haplotypic statistics in \gls{sam}.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p <- "SAM"

(sam_nsl_100 <- sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop == p) %>% arrange(desc(abs(statvalue))) %>% head(n=100) %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% arrange(desc(n)))

(sam_ihs_100 <- sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == p) %>% arrange(desc(abs(statvalue))) %>% head(n=100) %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% arrange(desc(n)))

inner_join(sam_nsl_100, sam_ihs_100, by = 'genename' ) %>% mutate(total = n.x + n.y) %>% arrange(desc(total))
rm(p)
```

From the haplotypic tests for selection (\gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}) there were `r sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == "SAM") %>% select(genename) %>% anti_join(., sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop != "SAM") %>% select(genename), by = 'genename') %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` genes that were only significant in \gls{sam} for \gls{ihs}, and `r sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop == "SAM") %>% select(genename) %>% anti_join(., sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop != "SAM") %>% select(genename), by = 'genename') %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` for \gls{nsl}. The genes with the most significant markers for \gls{ihs} were _CDH23_ and _CNTN5_ with 12 significant markers each. The gene with the most significant markers for \gls{nsl} was _CDH23_ with 16 markers. Looking at the most extreme 100 markers for \gls{ihs} there were 35 genes represented, _SNX29_ had the most with three markers. For \gls{nsl} the most markers in the most extreme 100 was _C11orf65._ There was a total of 39 genes represented. Between the top markers for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} there were 10 genes that were in common. There were six genes that had windows from at least four of the frequency-based statistics and also had at least a single significant marker for either \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl}. The genes were _DISP_ (two \gls{ihs} markers), _PARD3B_ (one \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} marker each), _NEK1_ (one \gls{ihs} marker), _CTNNA3_ (one \gls{ihs} marker and five \gls{nsl} markers), _CEP112_ (one \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} marker each), and _SUPT3H_ (one \gls{nsl} marker). \gls{xpehh} had 19 genes that had at least 20 populations with significant markers in only \gls{sam} from the Polynesian populations but none had been associated with urate or related co-morbidities.


<!-- PARD3B had 4 different statistics overlap under exon XXX. -->


<!-- Nearly all of the windows and markers that intersected _CNTNAP5_ were overlapping and fell between chr2:125545002-125675001, with the most overlap occurring in an intronic region (Figure \@ref(fig:samCNTNAP5)). -->




```{r, eval = FALSE}
q <- xpehh %>%  select(-popid1, -popid2, -posid, -experimentid, -statvalue) %>% filter(pop1 %in% c("CIM","NZM","SAM","TON"), xpehh_value > 0) %>% select(pop1,pop2, genename) %>% distinct() %>% left_join(., panel %>% select(pop2 = pop, super_pop) %>% distinct(), by = 'pop2') %>% group_by(pop1, super_pop, genename) %>% tally() %>% spread(super_pop, n, 0)%>% arrange(genename) %>% mutate(rs = AFR + AMR + EAS + EUR + POL + SAS) %>% filter(rs >=20) %>% select(pop1, genename, rs) %>% spread(pop1, rs) %>% filter(is.na(CIM),is.na(NZM), !is.na(SAM), is.na(TON)) %>% pull(genename)
q[q %in% genelists$genename]
```


##### Consecutive regions of score depression in \gls{sam}

There were no consecutively depressed score regions that intersected with genes associated with urate, obesity, \gls{t2d}, kidney disease, or metabolic syndrome. Regions of consecutive depressed score that also had significant markers for \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} in \gls{sam} covered three regions of the genome across two statistics. \gls{td} had two regions, the first was 400 kb at chr4:170025002-170425001 and had a single significant marker for \gls{ihs} in _NEK1_. The second region was 300 kb in length and was found at chr10:76685002-76985001. It had two markers that were significant  for \gls{ihs} and three for \gls{nsl} in _KAT6B_, two markers each for \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} at _SAMD8_, and two markers each fro \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} for DUSP13. \gls{flf} had a single 200 kb region at chr1:26465002-26665001 that had a single significant marker for \gls{nsl} in _CNKSR1_, and two markers for \gls{ihs} and three for \gls{nsl} in _AIM1L._

##### Pathway enrichment analysis of selected loci in \gls{ton}

<!-- Functional classification using PantherDB for the significant windows from the 1st percentile for the frequency spectrum selection and neutrality tests, and the significant \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} each individually, had the main biological process classification as "cellular process" and the second main classification as 'metabolic process'. Combining all the significant genes from any -->

Pathway enrichment analysis from the Enrichr KEGG 2016 pathways had `r kegg_sig %>% filter(pop == 'ton') %>% select(Term) %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` different pathways that were significant after multiple testing correction. Of the \gls{sfs} based methods, only \gls{flf} had a significant pathway and this was "Olfactory transduction". There were two pathway terms that were significant from the \gls{ihs} results, these were "ABC transporters" and "ECM-receptor interaction". These were also significant in the \gls{nsl} results, along with another eight terms (Table \@ref(tab:keggPath)). Five of the significant pathway terms were only significant in \gls{ton} out of the Polynesian populations.


##### Selection from haplotypic statistics in \gls{ton}.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p <- "TON"

(ton_nsl_100 <- sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop == p) %>% arrange(desc(abs(statvalue))) %>% head(n=100) %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% arrange(desc(n)))

(ton_ihs_100 <- sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == p) %>% arrange(desc(abs(statvalue))) %>% head(n=100) %>% group_by(genename) %>% tally() %>% arrange(desc(n)))

inner_join(ton_nsl_100, ton_ihs_100, by = 'genename' ) %>% mutate(total = n.x + n.y) %>% arrange(desc(total))
rm(p)
```


In total there were  `r sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == "TON") %>% select(genename) %>% anti_join(., sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop != "TON") %>% select(genename), by = 'genename') %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` genes that were only significant in \gls{ton} for \gls{ihs}, and `r sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop == "TON") %>% select(genename) %>% anti_join(., sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop !="TON") %>% select(genename), by = 'genename') %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` for \gls{nsl}. In the most extreme 100 \gls{ihs} marker scores, there were 32 genes represented with _SNX29_ having three markers, and _CDH23_ having two from the 100. The most extreme 100 markers for \gls{nsl} had 30 genes represented with SNX29 having five markers, _PCDH15_ having three, and _DNAH11_ having two of the 100 markers. There was an overlap between the two genelists for the most extreme 100 of six genes, with _SNX29_, and _DNAH11_ having the most number of extreme markers for both \gls{ihs}, and \gls{nsl}. The genes with the most number of significant markers overall for \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} were _CPNE4_ (16 markers for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}), _SNX29_ (15 markers for \gls{ihs} and 16 for \gls{nsl}), _CDH23_ (11 markers for \gls{ihs} and 12 for \gls{nsl}), _PCDH15_ (12 markers for \gls{nsl}), and _BANK1_ (9 markers for \gls{ihs} and 10 for \gls{nsl}). There were 37 genes that had at least 20 populations with significant markers for \gls{xpehh} in only TON from the Polynesian populations, including _IGF1R_, _JAZF1_, and _PEPD_ which had been associated with urate or co-morbidities. Combining the genes with at least a single significant marker for either \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} with the windows in the 1st percentile for at least four frequency-based intra-population selection and neutrality statistics had three genes that met this criteria. They were _SUPT3H_, _LPO_, and _NRXN3._


```{r, eval = FALSE}
q <- xpehh %>%  select(-popid1, -popid2, -posid, -experimentid, -statvalue) %>% filter(pop1 %in% c("CIM","NZM","SAM","TON"), xpehh_value > 0) %>% select(pop1,pop2, genename) %>% distinct() %>% left_join(., panel %>% select(pop2 = pop, super_pop) %>% distinct(), by = 'pop2') %>% group_by(pop1, super_pop, genename) %>% tally() %>% spread(super_pop, n, 0)%>% arrange(genename) %>% mutate(rs = AFR + AMR + EAS + EUR + POL + SAS) %>% filter(rs >=20) %>% select(pop1, genename, rs) %>% spread(pop1, rs) %>% filter(is.na(CIM),is.na(NZM), is.na(SAM), !is.na(TON)) %>% pull(genename)

##### Consecutive regions of score depression in \gls{ton}

There were no consecutively depressed score regions that intersected genes associated with urate, \gls{t2d}, kidney disease, or metabolic syndrome. There was one region that intersected the obesity associated gene _CCR3_ for \gls{td} and was 260 kb in length at chr3:46035002-46295001. There were three regions with consecutively depressed score that also had significant markers for \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} in \gls{ton}. \gls{td} had two regions. The first similar to \gls{sam}, was at chr10:76685002-76985001 and spanned 300 kb and had three significant markers for \gls{ihs} and four for \gls{nsl} in _KAT6B_, three markers for both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} in _SAMD8_, and two markers each for \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} in _DUSP13._ The second region at chr17:56125002-56415001 was 290 kb and had a single significant marker for \gls{ihs} in both _EPX_ and _LPO_. \gls{flf} had a slightly shifted region that also covered _EPX_ and _LPO_, but also included _RNF43_. All three genes had a single significant marker each for \gls{ihs}. The region was at chr17:56205002-56455001 and was 250 kb in length.

<!-- Genes talked about are cherry picked based on  -->

<!-- - number of snps that were significant -->
<!-- - SFS and haplotypic -->
<!-- - multiple polynesian populations -->
<!-- - only significant (or highly enriched) within the polynesians -->
<!-- - on multiple gene lists -->
<!-- - prioritised haplotypic results -->

In order to establish if there was evidence of selection in genes associated with urate and diseases with \gls{hu} as a co-morbidity, loci that associated with these conditions were extracted from the \gls{gwas} catalog (as per Section \@ref(diseaselist), see Table \@ref(tab:gwascatref) for references for each trait) and neutrality and selection statistics that intersected these loci were collated. Table \@ref(tab:superDiseaseGenesTab) shows the break down of the number of different statistics by population that met the significance thresholds for the \gls{sfs} based statistics, the haplotype based statistics, and the overlap between the frequency spectrum and haplotypic methods. The \gls{cim} had the least number of genes of the Polynesian populations that had a significant result out of the genes that were associated with urate. The Polynesian populations had the lowest number of genes with significant \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} for obesity and the Western Polynesian populations had the lowest number of genes for \gls{t2d}.

The `r urate_goutGR$SYMBOL %>% unique() %>% length()` loci identified through \gls{gwas} [@Kottgen2013] as being associated with urate and gout only had a small proportion with any evidence of possible selection. In the Polynesian populations, from the intra-population neutrality and selection statistics, there were 10 genes that had some evidence. However, there were only three genes with haplotypic evidence, and only one gene (_PRKAG2_) that had both haplotypic and \gls{sfs}-based evidence. The Western Polynesian populations were the only Polynesian populations to have haplotypic-based evidence. Overall, the Polynesian populations did not have more urate genes with evidence than the other populations (Table \@ref(tab:superDiseaseGenesTab)).

The two main effect loci for serum urate, _SLC2A9_ and _ABCG2_ both had limited evidence of selection. _SLC2A9_ did not have any values for \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} because of an extended region of no recombination leading to a large gap in the reference genome which caused the \gls{ehh} calculation to be terminated. There was evidence with \gls{fld} and \gls{flf} which both had windows from _SLC2A9_ in the 1st percentile from \gls{ton}. This was also observed with the \gls{eas} populations of \gls{chb} and \gls{jpt}. For Polynesian populations, _ABCG2_ only had  significant results from \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} at the same marker (rs2622626) for \gls{ton}. With \gls{ihs} the \gls{sas} populations of \gls{gih} and \gls{itu} also had significant values for rs2622626. For \gls{nsl}, along with \gls{gih}, and \gls{itu}, the other non-Polynesian populations that had a significant value was the \gls{eas} population \gls{jpt}, and the \gls{afr} population of \gls{yri}. Rs2622626 is associated with both urate and gout [@Kottgen2013]. There were no Polynesian populations with values in the 1st percentile for the frequency-based statistics, and only \gls{esn} had windows that met the threshold for \gls{fwh}. The only other transporter that was associated with urate that had a window meeting the significance threshold in Polynesian populations was _SLC16A9_ in \gls{ton} for \gls{fld}.

Table \@ref(tab:uratePol) shows all urate and gout associated genes that had any evidence of possible selection in the Polynesian populations. Some genes of interest included _IGF1R_ and _RREB1_ which both had significant markers with \gls{xpehh} between nearly all Polynesian populations and many of the other populations excepting those in the \gls{sas} super population. _RREB1_ is also associated with \gls{t2d} [@mahajan2014genome]. _BCAS3_ had multiple windows that met the lower threshold for \gls{fwh}, \gls{fld}, \gls{flf}, and \gls{td} in the Polynesian populations but did not have any significant markers for the haplotypic tests of selection. There were no regions of consecutive score depression in the Polynesian populations that intersected the urate and gout loci.

<!-- rs2622626 is the snp that is significant in ton, but also SAS - GIH and ITU, and JPT. should check to see if it is in LD with the gwas hits -->

There were `r length(unique(obesity_GR$SYMBOL))` obesity-associated loci with three loci in common with urate and gout from the \gls{gwas} catalog (see Table \@ref(tab:gwascatref) for references). The Polynesian populations had about 10% of the obesity-associated genes showing some evidence of possible selection (Table \@ref(tab:superDiseaseGenesTab)). As a super population, the Polynesian populations had fewer obesity-associated genes that were significant for \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} compared to the other super populations. Genes that were associated with obesity and had evidence across multiple populations or many significant results are included in Table \@ref(tab:obesityPol). Five loci had evidence in all four Polynesian populations, from a combination of haplotypic and \gls{sfs} statistics, these were _ABO_, _ARL15_, _CCR3_, _COL6A1_, and _ERBB4_. _ABO_ is discussed further in subsection \@ref(malariaRes) in the context of malaria. There were nine obesity associated loci that of the Polynesian populations, the Eastern Polynesian populations had either the entire or the largest signal, these were _MTIF3_, _ADAMTS9_, _ADCY9_, _CCNJL_, _DNAH10_, _PCSK5_, _ACAN_, _BTNL2_, _LY86_. Conversely, ten loci had their entire or largest signal in the Western Polynesian populations, these were _JAZF1_, _PEPD_, _RABEP1_, _LRP1B_, _BDNF_, _FAM13A_, _FER_, _GPRC5B_, _GRID1_, and _SLC39A8_. Four of the loci, _ADAMTS9_, _ARL15_, _JAZF1_, and _PEPD_ were also associated with \gls{t2d}. _FTO_ did have a single marker (rs4396532) that was significant for \gls{ihs} in \gls{nzm}.

Consecutively depressed score regions were in \gls{cim} at chr3:52375002-52615001 and intersected _NT5DC2_ and _PBRM1_ for \gls{fld} in \gls{cim}. Another region was at chr12:124195002-124505001 for \gls{flf} that covered _DNAH10_, _ZNF664_, and _CCDC92._ Both \gls{cim} and \gls{nzm} had a region that intersected _NLRC3_. The \gls{cim} region was for \gls{flf} at  chr16:3545002-3795001, whereas the \gls{nzm} region was slightly smaller and for \gls{fld} at chr16:3555002-3775001. For \gls{td} there were two regions of consecutive score depression that intersected obesity-associated loci, the first in \gls{nzm} at chr16:67145002-67465001 intersected _KCTD19._ The second was in \gls{ton} covered _CCR3_ at chr3:46035002-46295001.

\Gls{t2d} is a co-morbidity of hyperuricemia, and had `r length(unique(t2d_GR$SYMBOL))` genes associated from \gls{gwas} in the \gls{gwas} catalog (see Table \@ref(tab:gwascatref) for references), with one gene in common with urate-associated loci, and 16 genes in common with obesity. For the Polynesian populations there were `r lower_sig_stats %>% filter(SYMBOL %in% t2d_GR$SYMBOL, pop  %in% poly_pop) %>% select(SYMBOL) %>% distinct() %>% NROW()` loci that were intersected by windows in the 1st percentile of a frequency based statistic.

The genes that showed evidence of possible selection across multiple Polynesian populations and statistics are shown in Table \@ref(tab:t2dPol). There were five genes that showed evidence across all Polynesian populations, these were _ARL15_, _LPP_, _PTPRD_, _SND1_, and _THADA._ Three genes had evidence that was mostly in the Eastern Polynesian populations, these were _ADAMTS9_, _PSMD6_, _SSR1_. And the genes that mostly had evidence in the Western Polynesians were _BCL11A_, _JAZF1_, _KCNJ11_, and _PEPD_. As previously mentioned _ADAMTS9_, _ARL15_, _JAZF1_, and _PEPD_ were also associated with obesity.


There were no regions of consecutive score depression for any of the \gls{sfs} based intra-population statistics for any of the Polynesian populations.

Urate has associations with neurological disease, such as the potential as a biomarker for the progression of Parkinson's disease [@Wen2017]. Loci that were associated with the neurological diseases of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease from the \gls{gwas} catalog did not intersect with any regions of consecutive score depression of any \gls{sfs}-based statistic. All four Polynesian populations had significant \gls{xpehh} values with populations from the \gls{afr} and \gls{amr} super populations at the _CNTNAP2_ locus. The Western Polynesian populations also had significant \gls{xpehh} values with \gls{eur} populations. There were significant markers for \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} for \gls{nzm} and \gls{sam}. All Polynesians populations also had windows in the 1st percentile for \gls{fwh}, with \gls{nzm} having the most with 12. All Polynesians also had windows in the 1st percentile for \gls{td} that intersected _CNTNAP2_. Another locus, _CERS6_, had each Polynesian population with significant \gls{xpehh} markers with nearly all populations from the \gls{afr}, \gls{amr}, \gls{eur} super population groups and approximately half of the populations from both \gls{eas} and \gls{sas} super populations. A third locus that had significant \gls{xpehh} markers for all Polynesian populations was _SLC2A13_. All Polynesian populations had significant \gls{xpehh} markers with most populations from \gls{amr} and \gls{eas} super populations. \gls{nzm}, \gls{cim}, and \gls{sam} also had significant markers with nearly all populations of the \gls{sas} and \gls{eur}. Only \gls{nzm} had significant markers with the \gls{afr} populations. All Polynesian populations had significant markers for \gls{nsl} at _SLC2A13_, and also for \gls{ihs} except for \gls{cim}. _VPS13_ had both Eastern Polynesian populations with two significant \gls{ihs} markers, and windows from the 1st percentile for \gls{fld} (five windows), \gls{flf} (six windows), and \gls{ze} (nine windows for \gls{nzm} and 11 for \gls{cim}).

<!-- Similar to neurological disease, urate is also a possible biomarker for psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder [@Albert2015]. The psychiatric disorders selected and gene lists created from were schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and there were `r length(unique(psychiatric_GR$SYMBOL))` genes associated with these diseases. Table  \@ref(tab:psychiatricPol) contains some of the genes that had multiple statistics, or multiple Polynesian populations with evidence of potential selection. One of the main results for this gene list was _CNTN4_ which was the gene with the highest number of significant \gls{snp}s with 27 significant markers for \gls{ihs} and 18 for \gls{nsl} in the \gls{cim} population. Except for \gls{nzm} had 14 markers that were significant for \gls{ihs} and 10 for \gls{nsl}, there was no other population that had more than two significant markers at _CNTN4_. _AUTS2_ was a gene that had a large number of \gls{fwh} windows in the 1st percentile (18) for \gls{fwh} in \gls{nzm} but the only other populations with more than two windows were \gls{ceu}, \gls{clm}, and \gls{gbr}. However, this didn't reach the threshold for being defined as a consecutive region of score depression. -->

The list of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders was from @Zhang2013a Table 2, and included: inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, primary biliary cirrhosis, and vitligo. Autoimmunity is caused by the immune system attacking self rather than foreign antigen and involves both innate and adaptive immune response [@Waldner2009]. The genes involved with the immune response have been suggested as possible candidates of selection [@Grossman2013]. Both gout and these disorders have a common cause from the activation of the immune system.

There were `r length(unique(zhang_immune_GR$SYMBOL))` genes associated with these inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, many of which were also in common with the genes associated with urate, obesity, \gls{t2d}, kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome, which is indicative of the immune response being part of all of these conditions. Some of the loci that had multiple statistics, across multiple Polynesian populations indicating possible selection were: _ARHGEF3_, _ARL15_, _ATM_, _BLK_, _CCR3_, _CNTNAP2_, _DSTYK_, _FAM167A_, _FOXP1_, _KCNB2_, _LPP_, _LRRK2_, _RREB1_, _SLC2A13_, _ALCO6A1_, _THADA_, and _XKR6_. _CCR2_ and _FCHSD2_ had a higher number of significant results in the Eastern Polynesian populations, whereas _CDH23_ and _JAZF1_ had a higher number of significant results in the Western Polynesian populations. _CCR2_ and _CCR3_ were also associated with obesity, _ARL15_ and _JAZF1_ were associated with obesity and \gls{t2d}, _LPP_ and _THADA_ were associated \gls{t2d}, and _RREB1_ was associated with urate and \gls{t2d}. Some of the genes had very high numbers of windows from the 1st percentile for \gls{td} intersect with them, such as _RAD51B_ which was a consecutively depressed score region for \gls{sam}, and _XKR6_, which was a consecutively depressed score region for \gls{cim}, \gls{sam} and \gls{ton} populations.

Urate has a central role in malarial infection and triggering an immune response [@GallegoDelgado2014]. Given that immune response is a strong candidate to be under selective pressure, malaria associated genes were looked at to see if there were signals of selection. From the GWAS catalog there were three genes that had been associated with malaria (of six) that also had evidence of selection with the Polynesian populations. The three genes that also had significant \gls{ihs} scores with Polynesian populations were _ABO_, _ATP2B4_, and _DDC_.

_ABO_ was the only gene that had significant markers in all four Polynesian populations of the malaria associated genes, and this was only for \gls{ihs}. \gls{cim} had two markers that were significant, the first, rs1053878, was also significant in \gls{ton}. The second marker, rs55764262, was also significant in \gls{nzm} and \gls{sam}, and was in high \gls{ld} (\gls{eas} R^2^ = 0.967) with rs549446. Rs549446 was significant in both \gls{chs} and \gls{jpt}. There were no windows from the frequency-based statistics that met the significance threshold. _ABO_ has also been associated with obesity in \gls{gwas} [@Comuzzie2012]. The marker rs8176741 had been associated with severe malaria [@Timmann2012], however, this marker had a significant \gls{ihs} in \gls{fin} but no other populations. The other \gls{snp}s that showed significance for \gls{ihs} were not in \gls{ld} (\gls{eas} R^2^ = 0.002) with rs55764262, for which \gls{cim}, \gls{nzm} and \gls{sam} all had a significant result. Both \gls{cim} and \gls{ton} had a different marker (rs1053878) that was significant for \gls{ihs} in _ABO_.


Both \gls{sam} and \gls{nzm} had \gls{snp}s that were significant for \gls{ihs} in _ATP2B4_, \gls{sam} had rs10494845, and \gls{nzm} had rs142206068. The malaria-associated variant was rs10900585 [@Timmann2012]. All three variants are in \gls{ld} (\gls{eas} R^2^ = 1.0).

_DDC_ encodes dopa decarboxylase and has been associated with malaria [@Jallow2009] and also \gls{bmi} [@Locke2015]. \gls{nzm} had significant markers for \gls{xpehh} for nearly all other populations, \gls{cim} had fewer populations, but across all super population other than \gls{sas}. The \gls{nzm} had multiple markers within the malaria-associated gene, _DDC_, for \gls{nsl}. The markers were rs2060762, rs3807558, rs2329371, and rs1966839. The same markers in addition with rs11238131 and rs4580999 were significant for \gls{ihs}. A \gls{ld} matrix with marker positions is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ldDDCnzm). The marker rs1966839 (reference/derived allele = T, alternative/ancestral allele = C) was in high LD (0.998) with the malaria-associated rs1451375 (reference/ancestral allele = C, alternative/derived = A) where the reference and alternative alleles correspond between the \gls{snp}s and both are intronic variants. Under a dominant model the A allele of rs1451375 is protective of severe malaria (OR = 0.75, CI = 0.66-0.85, P = 6 x 10-6) [@Jallow2009].

## Chapter Discussion
<!--
Important to remember that the modern day populations esp AFR won't necessarily have the same results as AFR pops did 100 kya

Pipeline discussion - how were the results?
  - Are the genes that are picked up similar to what has been discovered?

Is there anything special about the population comparisons?
  - shared genes between similar populations?
  - East/West split seen?
  - NZC vs GBR similarity?
  
  @Rafajlovic2014 has a good talk about the use of the empirical distribution for sfs stats.
  
  
Because fld and flf are based on the number of singletons, how is this going to be affected by using chip data that should have essentially 0. presumable this will dramatically affect the interpretability of the statistic and push everything over to the right but is it acceptable to recentre the distribution and look that the extremes from there? does it have biological plausibility?  

what does it mean to have a significant window of one tail neighboured by the other tail? Or on the broad scale what does it mean to have a gene classed as significant in both tails?

### Identifying regions under selection in Polynesian populations

One of the primary objectives of this chapter were to investigate regions that were under selection in Polynesian populations. From the intra-population statistics used, there were between 866 and 974 genes identified in the Polynesian populations that had both intra-population haplotypic and \gls{sfs} statistics that were in the 1st percentile. The regions with possible evidence of selection showed that comparative to the other super populations, the Polynesian populations had the fewest genes that only had evidence within the Polynesian super population, whereas the African populations had the largest number of genes that only had evidence in the African super population (Figure \@ref(fig:superUpset)). The Polynesian populations had similar distributions of the \gls{sfs}-based statistics (explored more in Chapter 4).

Pathway analysis on the regions with possible selection in the Polynesian populations revealed that many of the genes that had evidence were involved with various forms of cell signalling, with many related to calcium channels. The gene _CNTN4_ had the highest number of significant markers in \gls{cim} and 3^rd^ most in \gls{nzm} for \gls{ihs}. This particular locus hasn't been associated with urate at a genome-wide significance level, however there is evidence of a potential association [@Chittoor2016]. 

> What are the genes that were coming up? what are the pathways that they were in?

> There were lots of voltage gated calcium channels, where are they expressed?


When looking at genes that have been associated with urate, gout and related co-morbidities, there is no apparent enrichment of genes for particular conditions in the Polynesian populations, when compared to the other populations (Table \@ref(tab:superDiseaseGenesTab)). This may indicate that there hasn't been any selection for the particular traits, but that individually genes may have been selected for, for other roles they play. There was also evidence of selection in loci that were associated with malaria and were also associated with \gls{t2d} and obesity.


<!-- - there is evidence of selection in urate associated loci in the Polynesian populations -->
<!-- - this evidence is not specific to urate however, this is evidenced by the fact that there is little signal in the urate transporters but it is in the loci that are part of more general metabolic pathways -->
<!-- - the reasons as to why there would be selection are unclear -->

<!-- - The pathways that showed enrichment were involved voltage-gated Ca channel. these channels are predominantly expressed in the lung and the heart. -->
<!-- - many of the pathways were involved with cell signalling/communication so are vital for life -->




### Selection of Urate Associated Genes

The second objective was to investigate regions associated with urate, gout and related co-morbidities for evidence of selection in the Polynesian populations. There was evidence for selection in urate associated loci. However, the evidence did not appear to be specific for urate itself, but for loci that are involved in more general metabolic pathways. The main effect loci identified through \gls{gwas}, _SLC2A9_ and _ABCG2_, had limited evidence of positive selection. _ABCG2_ had a significant marker (rs2622626) with \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} and only in \gls{ton} from the Polynesian populations, the only other populations were \gls{gih} and \gls{itu} from the \gls{sas} super population. This marker showing significance however might be due to the gout prevalence of the \gls{ton} sample population which was 54%, the same result is not seen in closest population with the most similar ancestral background, \gls{sam}, where the prevalence of gout in the sample population was much lower at 12%.

Only _RREB1_ and _IGFR1_ had haplotypic evidence with \gls{xpehh} across multiple other populations. The other gene of note that didn't have haplotypic evidence, but did have multiple windows in the 1st percentile across multiple statistics and all Polynesian populations was _BCAS3._ _BCAS3_ had been previously identified as selected in @Grossman2013. _RREB1_ was also associated with obesity and \gls{t2d} traits. @Zhang2013a had reported a variant nearby to _RREB1_ (rs675209) as having evidence of selection but this particular marker was absent from the CoreExome chip.

There was a similar situation with obesity, \gls{t2d}, kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome where it was found that there were multiple loci that had evidence of possible selection. The number of genes that had possible evidence of selection was similar in the Polynesian populations to that of the other populations. An interesting point however, was the Western Polynesian populations had the fewest genes associated with \gls{t2d} identified with \gls{ihs} or \gls{nsl} than all the other populations, despite Polynesian populations having a high prevalence of \gls{t2d} [@Winnard2013]. 

Other complex diseases such as the neurological, and, inflammatory and autoimmune also showed multiple genes that showed evidence of selection. One of the 'themes' that appeared was there was genes were often involved in multiple diseases or gene lists, and often involved with the immune system.

The locus also extends to ALDH2 which @Oota2004 suggests is under selection -->


### Thrifty gene hypothesis

There was no evidence of selection in either of the previously identified loci of _PPARGC1A_ and _CREBRF_ in Polynesian populations. The CoreExome chip did not have rs8192678, but it did have rs1873532 which was in high \gls{ld} (\gls{eas} R^2^ = 0.976). The lack of evidence was consistent with the results of @Cadzow2016 for _PPARGC1A_ where there was no indication of selection from frequency- or haplotype-based methods. 

No selection signal was observed at _CREBRF_ in any of the Polynesian populations that were tested. One reason for this is that the CoreExome chip did not have the specific variants reported in @Minster2016. Downstream from _CREBRF_ there was a consistent signal with what had been reported. This was only found in the Western Polynesian populations and the populations of the \gls{eas} super population so suggests that had the dataset contained the variants that it would have been possible to detect. However, without the two markers reported in @Minster2016 it is unable to be determined if _CREBRF_ had evidence of selection from the CoreExome data.

The pathway analysis of genes that were in the extremes for the different selection and neutrality statistics showed that pathways involved with cell signalling were the main results for the Polynesian populations, rather than metabolic pathways. The genes that indicated selection, even for obesity and \gls{t2d}, which are traditionally thought of as being the thrifty phenotype, were genes that were largely either neurological or involved in the immune system.

\gls{nzm} did have significant results for two diabetes related pathways, "Type II diabetes mellitus_Homo sapiens_hsa04930" and "Insulin secretion_Homo sapiens_hsa04911", however, only up to 10% of the pathways had genes that met the significance thresholds. Of the genes that were part of those pathways, up to 50% were genes that encoded subunits of a voltage-gated calcium channel. 

As discussed in @Gosling2014, the thrifty gene hypothesis in the context of the Pacific does not fit with the anthropological history, and from this analysis it appears to have no to minimal support from the loci that exhibit signals of possible selection. [@Ayub2014c] had a similar finding with respect to \gls{t2d}. While some individual loci show some signs of selection, it appears as if selection at \gls{t2d} loci is not the case.

### Malaria

Response to infectious challenge is a key mechanism that has been thought of as a selective pressure. Malarial infection provided a possible challenge to which urate may have been subjected to selective pressure as such provided a viable candidate due to the involvement of urate with malarial resistance [@GallegoDelgado2014]. There is also evidence of malaria in the prehistory skeletal remains of the western Pacific islands [@buckley2006predators]. Six loci that were associated with malaria and identified from the \gls{gwas} catalog were investigated for having signals of selection. Three of these genes did have evidence of selection in the Polynesian populations. Two loci that had evidence had also been identified as being associated with obesity and \gls{t2d}. _ABO_ and _ATP2B4_ did not have strong evidence, and it came from only \gls{ihs}. _ATP2B4_ encodes a plasma membrane calcium transporter, another calcium related gene with evidence of selection in \gls{nzm}. _DDC_ on the other hand had comparatively strong haplotypic evidence in the Eastern Polynesian populations. \gls{nzm} had significant \gls{xpehh} results with every other non-Polynesian population and had six significant markers for \gls{ihs}, three of which were in the top 400 most extreme scores. Rs1966839 in _DDC_ was in near perfect \gls{ld} with the malaria associated intronic variant rs1451375 [@Jallow2009].

From the obesity \gls{gwas} associated gene list, there was _ADCY9_, which had a very strong signal for \gls{ihs} for 7 markers in \gls{cim} and 2 markers in \gls{nzm}, that were the only populations with significant \gls{ihs} values. A variant, rs10775349, in _ADCY9_ has been associated with malaria in a candidate gene approach but not in \gls{gwas} [@Maiga2013].

Three of the four loci had possible evidence of selection and were associated with obesity traits. The fourth, _ATP2B4_, being a calcium pump showed similarity with the pathways that showed significant enrichment in Polynesian populations by being related to calcium.

<!-- The malarial resistance gene _HBB_ (identified in [@Currat2002; @Ohasi2004]) was not identified as having evidence of selection -->

### Study Limitations {#chap3limit}

There were some technical limitations of the study that influenced the results obtained. The use of a \gls{snp} chip meant that there was an ascertainment bias built into the markers observed [@nielsen2007recent]. The quality control process for the CoreExome \gls{snp} chip also has a bias against singletons and low minor allele frequency \gls{snp}s [@Guo2014]. The effect of this was seen in the right shifting of the distributions of the intra-population frequency based statistics of \gls{td}, \gls{fld}, \gls{flf}, and \gls{ze}, all of which make use of low frequency or singleton variants in their calculations (Table \@ref(tab:superGlobalSummary)). This shift was not observed in \gls{fwh} which compared the ratio of high frequency derived and ancestral allele variants with the intermediate frequency variants. The shift was seen in \gls{td}, however with the African populations being shifted to the right, such that the first percentile for many was above zero. The intermediate and high frequency variants being over represented compared to the actual situation and will also have had an impact on the haplotypic statitics due to haplotypes that have low-frequency variants being altered.

Another technical limitation that affected the haplotypes was phasing. The phasing of the haplotypes for the Polynesian populations made use of the 1000 Genomes Project reference haplotype panel for probabilistic phasing and could not make use of trios. This panel does not contain Polynesian-specific haplotypes and so the phasing would be influenced by this. While the majority of common haplotypes will be represented in this panel, haplotypes that are Polynesian-specific are not and this introduces incorrect genotypes. The phasing uncertainty is also not taken into account for any of the methods, this will influence the haplotypic methods of selection. 

With the adaptation of the selection and neutrality tests into genome-wide usage, specifically the sliding window approach, there was the need to balance the number of segregating sites with the window size [@Pybus2014]. This balance is entirely influenced by \gls{snp} density with whole genome (re)sequence data offering 78 million bi-allelic \gls{snp}s in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. However, the CoreExome \gls{snp} chip data had lower density at `r lapply(1:22, function(x){diff(markers %>% filter(chrom ==x) %>% arrange(chrom_start) %>% pull(chrom_start))}) %>% unlist() %>%  mean() %>% round_dp(., 0)` \gls{snp}s/kbp. This means that window size needs to increase for \gls{snp} chip data in order to have the same number of segregating sites. However, as window size increases it also reduces the resolution of the genome and with it the ability to associate a window with particular genomic features.

There was also a higher likelihood of a longer gene being reported as significant due to more windows overlapping the genic region. Not only that, but the window size meant that \gls{snp}s not in the window might not even be near the actual window i.e. -45 and +45 kb away from the edge of the defined window in the worst case. This would lead to some difficulty in definitive location. The flip side to this was that it allows for upstream and downstream effects of a \gls{snp} to be incorporated. There was a trade off between \gls{snp} density and window size. There were `r NROW(markers)` bi-allelic \gls{snp} markers used in this analysis from the CoreExome chip. This was less than the other projects such as the HapMap project, and considerably less than the sequence data that the 1000 Genomes Project used. The marker density may have been able to be improved up though the imputation of the missing markers using a haplotype reference panel. Ideally this analysis would have had a higher marker density, however it was decided that it was best to remain unimputed due to both the haplotype uncertainty at the phasing step and the Polynesian populations not being represented in the reference panel. An example of why having Polynesian haplotypes represented is the finding of @Minster2016, where the variant had no appreciable allele frequency outside of Polynesia. Implications from the marker density used are the number of \gls{snp}s per window was lower than in other studies and specifically when looking at the degradation of haplotypes there is the possibility for early truncation due to lack of data.

The method itself of using the empirical distribution and selecting the extremes for a statistic to determine the region under selection does have precedence [@voight2006map; @Hider2013; @Jonnalagadda2017], however, this does assume that selection had occurred. The underlying null distribution of the genome is also unknown. It does need to be acknowledged that using the extremes of the distribution is likely to lead to many false positives [@Teshima2006]. This was somewhat mitigated in this study by using the permutations of the actual data to calculate the expected \gls{fdr}.

Allele frequency methods, and also the haplotypic methods may get confounded by the gout prevalences of the Polynesian sample sets, especially the \gls{cim} and \gls{ton} sets, where the prevalence is up to five-fold higher than the general population prevalence for those populations. Loci that showed evidence in multiple populations that did not have this enrichment for the disease trait would be expected to have more credibility. This is important to consider to for the co-morbidities of gout too, given the commonalities in associated genes.

One of the limitations of using the \gls{gwas} catalog to create gene lists for conditions is that there is a heavy over representation of genes that are associated to disease in Europeans due to the overall bias to \gls{gwas} research being conducted in European populations [@Haga2010; @Popejoy2016]. This can mean that population-specific associations are missed [@Weissglas-Volkov2013; @Minster2016]. Genes that are associated with a condition can also be missed if they do not reach genome-wide significance in a \gls{gwas} but in a candidate gene approach are significant for instance _ADCY9_ being nominally significant for \gls{bmi} at a genome-wide level but only significant for malaria in a candidate gene approach. 

<!-- One of the methods to still use the selection and neutrality tests with the genome-wide data was to use the empirical distribution [@Teshima2006; @Clarke?] -->


<!-- - imputation from the chip might not work well given the polys aren't (unconfirmed) well represented in the reference panel -->

<!-- - larger genes had a higher likelihood of being 'interesting' due to having the chance of a window intersecting it -->



### Conclusion

The results of this study show there is indeed evidence indicative of selection in urate-associated loci in the Polynesian populations. This evidence however is not specific to urate. This is shown by the fact that there is little signal of selection appearing at the urate transporters themselves, but at the loci that are part of more general pathways. The reasons for why there would be selection still remain unclear but response to pathogenic challenge such as malaria is a potential mechanism.
