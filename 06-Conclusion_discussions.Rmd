# Conclusions and Discussions


summary of regions that were selected

was gout/urate and other diseases under selection?




- chip data
- imputation
- phasing
    - polynesians aren't in the 1kgp reference haplotypes
- filters
    - QC filters
    - HWE
    - MAF
    
use of the gwas catalog, while extremely useful in terms of automatic defining of gene lists, does have a few drawbacks

- there is a potential bias in the genes that are being reported, refer to the large bias in the gwas populations that are used -> heavily favour the europeans
- genes that are involved might not have been genome-wide significant and therefore get missed
- the techinicalities of annotating, the reported gene might not be the actual gene, what happens when the snp is intergenic (closest gene?),  

    
One of the limitations of using the gwas catalog is for gene associations
- bias of the populations
- genes that are involved might not be genome wide significant therefore missed



if it isn't selection, then what could explain the differences in the disease affections?

- bottlenecking
- migration
- admixture
- "drift"

talk about the distributions and that with the new push for sequence data, esp in poly that the it should be repeated
