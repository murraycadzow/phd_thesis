# Conclusions and Discussions


summary of regions that were selected

was gout/urate and other diseases under selection?




- chip data
- imputation
- phasing
    - polynesians aren't in the 1kgp reference haplotypes
- filters
    - QC filters
    - HWE
    - MAF
    
    
One of the limitations of using the gwas catalog is for gene associations
- bias of the populations
- genes that are involved might not be genome wide significant therefore missed
