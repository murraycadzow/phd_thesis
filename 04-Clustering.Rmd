# Clustering of Selection Statistics

this is a test for the \gls{nz} acronymn feature to see when \gls{nz} becomes and acronymn \gls{t2d} is here as a test


In this chapter I will investigate the idea that populations that share ancestry will display similar signals of selection. To test this Idea I will be clustering the various selection statistics and then comparing the clusters to current population migratory history.

## introduction

<!--
* introduce the out of africa history
* cover the pacific migrations
* Near versus Remote Oceania
* migration to NZ from pacific islands
-->


## methods
Selection pipeline:
Tajimas D window of 30k
Fay and Wu's H window of 30k, slide of 3k
iHS/nSL 
F~ST~

## results

### based on top X results
1. Tajima's D heatmap

2. Fay and Wu's H heatmap


### based on gene lists

#### urate/gout

#### BMI

#### T2D
