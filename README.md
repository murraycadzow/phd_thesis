This repository contains the underlying code that I used in the creation of my PhD thesis.

The bulk of the thesis was written using bookdown and compiled using the Makefile with a few tweaks to get the final product, such as manually moving where the references were in the tex file so they came before the appendices. I also slightly customised the latex template that was downloaded from the Dept of Computer Science, University of Otago.

The final submitted version is found at https://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/handle/10523/8536 and also lives in Submitted/ in the repo.
