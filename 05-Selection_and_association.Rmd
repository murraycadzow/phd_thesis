_genome-wide association studies_

Genome-wide association studies provide a statistical framework for an association analysis between a phenotype of interest, and a genotypes of a genetic marker, usually using linear regression for a continuous trait, or logisitic regression for a dichotomous trait. The association test in a gwas is repeated for all available markers across the genome.  

_Introduction of ukbiobank_

The UK Biobank is a publically available data set consisting of 500,000 individuals, mostly of European ancestry, from around the United Kingdom, aged between 40 and 69. It consists of genetic, health, and lifestype information. As part of the UK Biobank, participants filled in detailed surveys on health and lifestyle questions, provided biological samples, and were genotyped on an Axiom array with 820,967 markers (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The genotypes were phased using SHAPEIT3, and then imputed using IMPUTE2 with both the UK10K impute reference panel, and the haplotype reference consortium impute panel, to bring the total number of \glspl{snp} to approximately 73.3 milion.


_Motivation behind using the different definitions_

In epidemiological studies the use of an accurate case definition is important. 

There is variation in the gout definitions used from the multipurpose cohort studies that are used for genetic analysis. 

Consistent case definition is also important for comparisons between cohorts, this can be done by combining the genetic data and performing the \gls{gwas}. Another common way of combining genetic association studies is through meta-analysis. Having the same case definitions between studies reduces the variations 

For gout, the gold standard case definition is the mono-soldium urate crystals in the synovial fluid of the joint. A sustitute for crystals in the synovial fluid is the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. The criteria require a minimum of six of twelve conditions to be met. 

It is uncommon for multipurpose cohorts to report either the gold-standard, or ACR criteria, and instead more common for a self-report diagnosis to be reported. The UK Biobank includes the self-report diagnosis that were collected by survey at the time of recruitment, but it also has hospital admission information, for both primary and secondary diagnosis.  



Power of genetic case-control studies increases with accurate case definition. This means that there are the maximum number of cases, and the maximum number of disease free controls.

## Methods

### European Gout GWAS {#ukbbgwas}

<!-- acr report using unfiltered controls -->
This \gls{gwas} was performed using the interim data release from the UK Biobank (approval number 12611) downloaded November 2015. There was genetic information for `r NROW(fam)` individuals. For the \gls{gwas} itself, it was limited to be only people who had self reported an ethnic background of British, Irish, or 'any other white background'.

Inclusion criteria were European ethnicity, aged between 40 and 69 years and had genome wide genotypes available. The exclusion criteria used was: mismatch between self-reported sex and genetic sex, genotype quality control failure, relatedness, or either a primary or secondary hospital diagnosis of kidney disease (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes I12, I13, N00-N05, N07, N11, N14, N17â€“N19, Q61, N25.0, Z49, Z94.0, Z99.2), participants aged 70 years and over, and those with kidney disease, because these are risk factors for secondary gout.


#### Classifications used

There were four main classification criteria that were used to define gout cases. _Hospital defined gout_ involved either a primary or secondary hospital diagnosis for gout (ICD-10 code M10, including sub-codes). _Self-report of gout_ was defined as reporting having gout at the time of the study interview. _Use of \gls{ult}_ used self-report data for the use of allopurinol, febuxostat, or sulphinpyrazone, and not having a hospital diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (ICD-10 codes C81-C96). _Winnard defined gout_ was based on @Winnard2012 and consisted of a hospital diagnosis of gout, or self report of gout specific medication (\gls{ult} or colchicine). The largest number of people were classified through either self-report or the use of urate lowering therapy (Figure \@ref(fig:ukbbupsetplot)). Additional exclusion criteria were applied to participants not classified as having gout from these definitions. The criteria were cortico-steroidal use, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or probenicid use. 

#### Model to decide covariates

Prior to conducting the \gls{gwas} for gout, phenotypic models were assessed using any method of classifying gout. Logistic regression was performed and the \gls{aic} for each model was used for model selection. The covariates used included: age, sex, BMI. Each covariate was significant on their own: age (P = \num{`r broom::tidy(models[[1]]$model) %>% filter(term == 'age') %>% .[['p.value']] %>% format(., scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)`}), sex (P = \num{`r broom::tidy(models[[2]]$model) %>% filter(term == 'sex_factormale') %>% .[['p.value']] %>% format(., scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)`}), and \gls{bmi} (P = \num{`r broom::tidy(models[[4]]$model) %>% filter(term == 'bmi') %>% .[['p.value']] %>% format(., scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)`}). In the combined model with all three covariates there was an AIC for the model of 19558.30 compared to models with each with age (\gls{aic} 22706.05), sex (\gls{aic} 21041.80) and \gls{bmi} (\gls{aic} 22001.03). Based on the \gls{aic} for the combined model, age, sex, and \gls{bmi} were used as the covariates in the \gls{gwas} for gout. The mean \gls{bmi} for all participants was `r ukbio_gout %>%ungroup() %>%  summarise(bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% pull(bmi) %>% round(., 2)` kg/m^2^, the mean age was `r ukbio_gout %>%ungroup() %>% summarise(age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% pull(age) %>% round(., 2)` years, and `r ukbio_gout %>%ungroup() %>% summarise(percent_male = (1 - sum(sex)/NROW(.)) *100) %>% pull(percent_male) %>% round(., 2)`% were male. A breakdown by affection status is in Table \@ref(tab:ukbbclin).

There were a total of `r ukbb_n$n_gout` individuals that had any classification of gout and `r ukbb_n$n_controls` controls. Of those with any classification of gout, there were `r ukbb_n$n_hosp` with a hospital diagnosis, `r ukbb_n$n_ult` with urate lowering therapy, `r ukbb_n$n_winnard` with the Winnard criteria, and `r ukbb_n$n_self` with self-reported gout. The overlaps in classification between each group can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:ukbbupsetplot). There was considerable overlap between the self-report, urate lowering therapy, and Winnard classifications with 1242 individuals meeting all three classifications.

Confidence intervals for proportions were calculated using the _prop.test_ function from the _stats_ package in R.

#### Gout association test

A \gls{gwas} was performed using logisitic regression in Plink1.9b [@plink] for each gout classification, with age, sex, and \gls{bmi} as co-variates. The association results for each \gls{gwas} were then compared with the 30 \glspl{snp} reported in Table 1 of @Kottgen2013 that had previously been associated with urate and gout in a cohort of >140,000 Europeans. 


#### Heriabililty

For each gout classification, the genetic component of heritability explained was calculated. This was done by first randomly selected 10,000 controls and then combining this same subset with cases from each of the gout classifications. The genetic variance was calculated for each chromosome separately and then combined. The dichotomous case-control phenotype was transformed onto the continuous liability scale using the restricted maximum likelihood analysis in gcta and a general population prevalence of gout of 2% (\@ref(gctaHeritability)). Estimates were compared using the formula h~1~ - h~2~ and the SE calculated using formula \@ref(eq:h2se).


\begin{equation} 
 SE = \sqrt{SE_1^2 + SE_2^2}
 (\#eq:h2se)

### Polynesian Gout GWAS

#### Polynesian gout gwas dataset

A multi-cohort gout dataset was assembled by combining individuals from the Genetics of Gout, Diabetes, and Kidney Disease in Aotearoa cohorts and the Ngati Porou Hauora Charitable Trust cohort. Genotyping on the Inifinium CoreExome v24 bead-chip was performed at the University of Queensland (Centre for Clinical Genomics) for the Genetics of Gout, Diabetes, and Kidney Disease in Aotearoa cohorts and at AgResearch (Invermay Agricultural Centre) for the Ngati Porou Hauora Charitable Trust cohort. The genotype quality control procedures as described in section \@ref(coreExomeQC) were applied per cohort, and then as necessary after combining the cohorts. The genotype quality control, and combining of cohorts was performed by Dr Tanya Major, Merriman Lab. \Glsdesc{pca} was performed on the combined dataset with the first 10 components outputted and 



#### Polynesian gout GWAS

A \gls{gwas} was also performed for individuals with Polynesian ancestry. 
Gout affection was determined by the American college of rheumatology criteria [@ref], or a doctor diagnosis, or enrolled in a gout drug trial. All participants were older than 18. Exclusion criteria included unknown gout affection status, non-Polynesian self-reported ancestry, or a mismatch between self-report ancestry and \gls{pca} clustering.

<!-- polynesian_gout-affection.pheno -->
<!--     - gout either ACR criteria or GP diagnosed / in a gout drug trial (only 119 not ACR) -->
<!--     - excluded unknown gout status, non-polynesian (either self-report or PCA mismatch), and people <18 years old -->


Principal components were 

The \gls{gwas} was adjusted for age, sex, and the first ten \glspl{pc} calculated from 2,858 ancestry informative markers (as identified by Illumina) 
The \gls{gwas} was conducted by Dr Tanya Major, a member of the Merriman Lab group.

#### Heritability Explained

```{r, engine='block', eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, include=FALSE }
here I want to include the results from the heritability analysis across the different criteria
```

To see if there was a difference between gout classifications in the genetic component of the variance explained by an additive model in gout, heritability estimates were calculated for each gout classification. To do this, 10000 controls were randomly selected and were used with each different gout criteria and heritability estimates for each chromosome were calculated using GCTA 1.26.0 [@Yang2011; @Yang2011part]. The heritability estimates were 0.289 (SE 0.034) for the self-report of gout or ULT use definition, 0.283 (SE 0.036) for the self-report of gout definition, 0.282 (SE 0.040) for the Winnard definition, 0.308 (SE 0.044) for the ULT use definition and 0.236 (SE 0.160) for the hospital diagnosis definition. There were no statistically significant differences between the heritability estimates of any of the different classifications. The heritability estimates were similar to estimates of genetic variance of serum urate [@Kottgen2013]




<!-- Kottgen refs 10-12 put heritability explained for serum urate at 40-70%. Kottgen reported heritability explained in serum urate loci that were adjusted for age and sex from 0.27 to 0.41. -->



### European selection

Compare the ukbiobank gwas results to those of the significant ihs/nsl snps

# ihs and nsl sig markers
sig_ihs_val <- readRDS('~/data/NZ_coreExome_1kgp/haplotype/sig_ihs_values_with_genes_14-11-2017.RDS') %>% filter(abs(statvalue) > 2 )
sig_nsl_val <- readRDS('~/data/NZ_coreExome_1kgp/haplotype/sig_nsl_values_with_genes_14-11-2017.RDS') %>% filter(abs(statvalue) > 2 )
```

```{r}
sig_ihs_val %>% filter(pop == 'GBR') %>% inner_join(., all_asb, by = c("chrom" = "CHR", "chrom_start" = "BP"))
```


```{r}
sig_nsl_val %>% filter(pop == 'GBR') %>% inner_join(., all_asb, by = c("chrom" = "CHR", "chrom_start" = "BP"))
```

### Polynesian GWAS and Selection





```{r}
polyGout <- read.table('~/data/PolyGwas/polynesian_gout_CoreExome24v1.0-1_rsIDconverted.assoc.logistic.tab', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
polyGout %>% filter(TEST == "ADD", P < 0.05) %>% qqman::manhattan(., ylim= c(0,10))
```


```{r}
polyGout %>% filter(TEST == "ADD", P < 1e-5)
```

The two markers that met the threshold for genome-wide significance, rs2725215 and rs2231142 located in _ABCG2_. Two other markers reached the nominal significance threshold, rs2728108 (_ABCG2_) and rs11034401 (inter-genic). This is a problem of having insufficient samples to have the power to detect the other gout loci.

In order to try and prioritise the variants of the gwas, combining the results of the logisitic regression with those of the selection analysis was done in order to investigate snps that did not reach the genome-wide threshold for sigificance in gwas but did have a significant ihs or nsl result.


```{r}
 sig_ihs_val %>% filter(superpop == 'POL') %>% inner_join(., polyGout %>% filter(P < 5e-2, TEST == "ADD"), by = c("chrom" = "CHR", "chrom_start" = "BP")) %>% spread(pop, statvalue) %>% arrange(P) %>% filter((!is.na(CIM) & !is.na(NZM)) | (!is.na(TON) & !is.na(SAM))) %>% filter(abs(NZM) > 2.6 | abs(CIM) > 2.6 | abs(SAM) > 2.6 | abs(TON) > 2.6) %>% select(-TEST, -statid, -contains('gene_'), -ensgeneid, -NMISS, -sig, -STAT) %>% kable(., longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE, format = 'latex')
```

```{r}
sig_ihs_val %>% filter(superpop == 'POL') %>% inner_join(., polyGout %>% filter(P < 5e-2, TEST == "ADD"), by = c("chrom" = "CHR", "chrom_start" = "BP")) %>% ggplot(., aes(x = -log10(P), y = statvalue)) + geom_point()

sig_nsl_val %>% filter(superpop == 'POL') %>% inner_join(., polyGout %>% filter(P < 5e-2, TEST == "ADD"), by = c("chrom" = "CHR", "chrom_start" = "BP")) %>% ggplot(., aes(x = -log10(P), y = statvalue)) + geom_point()
```

> Compared to the comparison in GWAS for gout with the ukbiobank, the Polynesian gwas did not have

----

UKBB paper discussion


- consistent findings with SUGAR paper
- in sugar paper highest spec/sense with self-report/ULT
- support the use of the self-report or ULT definition when better classification isn't available
- not all patients were captured by all criteria
- winnard was not as good as self-report or ULT use
- when self-report is info available recommend self-report/ULT
- all definitions tested abcg2/slc2a9 were genome-wide significant
- large effect sizes -> effect sizes in GWAS of control of SU levels - consistent with their role in regulation of SU and gout risk
- heritability estimates for variance explained by all common snps 0.282-0.308 (ex hospital def)
- within the range from kottgen (0.27-0.41) and they also calculated using GCTA for SU
- estimates of variance explained in european by common snps are comparable, suggesting that the common genetic variant-mediated heritabilities of SU and gout are similar
- diet, medications and other environmental factors contribute to risk of gout
- heritabilities are estimated under an additive model, so don't include non-additive variance (GxG and GxE), rare variants, CNV
- limited to european -> might not translate to other populations
- limited in that no gold-standard available to determine FPR/FNR

Poly gwas

ABCG2 is the usual contender, the other variant rs11034401is an intergenic variant on chr11

- talk about rs2231142 a little and why it is the main gout result

the polynesian gwas is largely underpowered

### Heritability explained

The heritability explained under an additive model for gout was similar to that which was reported for serum urate by @Kottgen2013. There were no statistically significant differences between the classifications. This could come down to the number of cases for each classification 

### GWAS and selection

There was limited seection for gout and urate assocaited loci in the \gls{gbr} population


### Limitations

- computationally the grm takes a lot of resources, hence only using 10000 controls, and not the full dataset
- the differences between the gwases for the ukbiobank are likely a numbers issue
- poly gwas
    - the lack of power -> samplesize
    - data set wasn't imputed
    - imputation of the Polynesian data is difficult, lack of reference haplotypes
    
- Poly selection/gwas
    - the selection results could be because of higher than general population prevalenvce of gout in the cohort
    - reduced markers used

- EUR selection/gwas
    - the greatly reduced number of markers because the selection results were calculated in the coreexome markers


> Maybe bring up the current discussion about the gcta for the use of heritability versus ldak?

<!-- Whole-genome principal component analysis vectors were calculated using a subset of 2,858 ancestry informative markers (as identified by Illumina) extracted from the CoreExome whole-genome genotypes. The SmartPCA (EIGENSOFT v6.0.1) [25]) program was used to perform this prinicipal component analysis, with an output of 10 eigenvectors, no outlier removal, and no population size limit. Individuals of non-Polynesian ancestry were included in the analysis group, and the first four vectors plotted against each other to view the clustering of ancestral groupings (Asian, European, Eastern Polynesian, and Western Polynesian). The first four vectors were chosen for inclusion as covariates in the linear regression to account for population stratification and cryptic relatedness, which may cause confounding. -->
<!-- The Illumina Infinium CoreExome v24 bead chip platform was used to genotype participants for ~500,000 variants across the whole-genome. Genotyping was performed at the University of Queensland (Centre for Clinical Genomics) for the Genetics of Gout, Diabetes, and Kidney Disease in Aotearoa cohorts and at AgResearch (Invermay Agricultural Centre) for the Ngati Porou Hauora Charitable Trust cohort. Bead chip genotyping batches were auto-clustered using GenomeStudio v2011.1 software (Illumina, San Diego). The Illumina GenomeStudio best practice guidelines and quality control protocols of Guo et al. (2014) were applied to these auto-clustered genotypes to ensure final genotype calls were of the highest possible quality [23, 24]. After the initial quality control protocols were applied the genotyping batches were merged and relevant quality control steps repeated in the full dataset. -->
