This chapter investigates the performance of different gout case definitions on \gls{gwas}. It also looks at how selection statistics could be used for the prioritisation of variants from \gls{gwas}.

Part of these results have been published as part of @Cadzow2017 and include the gout definition testing, heritability of gout, and the replication of the @Kottgen2013 results for gout, using the UK Biobank data. The results and discussion from this paper have been included and expanded on.

## Genetic associations with Gout

### Performance of gout definitions

Genome-wide association studies provide a statistical framework for an association analysis between a phenotype of interest, and a genotypes of a genetic marker, usually using linear regression for a continuous trait, or logistic regression for a dichotomous trait [@Lee2011;@Zuk2012]. The association test, in a \gls{gwas} context, is repeated for all available markers across the genome. In epidemiological studies the use of an accurate case definition is important. There is variation in the gout definitions used from the multi-purpose cohort studies that are used for genetic analysis, some well known cohorts include the Wellcome Trust case-control consortium cohort, the Atherosclerosis risk in the community study, and the Framingham Heart Study [@Burton2007;@Aric1989; @Splansky2007]. 

The use of a consistent case definition is also important for comparisons between cohorts, this can be done by combining the genetic data and performing the \gls{gwas}. Another common way of combining genetic association studies is through meta-analysis. In both instances, having the same case definitions between studies reduces the variation. Power of genetic case-control studies increases with accurate case definition. This means that there are the maximum number of cases, and the maximum number of disease free controls [@Colhoun2003]. For gout, the gold standard case definition is the mono-sodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid of the joint [@Wallace1977a]. A substitute for crystals in the synovial fluid is the \gls{acr} criteria [@Wallace1977a]. The criteria require a minimum of six of twelve conditions to be met. It is uncommon for multi-purpose cohorts to report either the gold-standard, or \gls{acr} criteria, but instead, for a self-report diagnosis of conditions and diseases to be reported.

The UK Biobank is a publicly available data set consisting of 500,000 individuals, mostly of European ancestry, from around the United Kingdom, aged between 40 and 69. It contains genetic, health, and lifestyle information. As part of the UK Biobank collection process, participants filled in detailed surveys on health and lifestyle questions, provided biological samples, and provided access to administrative health records. The UK Biobank includes the self-report diagnoses that were collected by survey at the time of recruitment, but it also has hospital admission information, for both primary and secondary diagnosis. This collection of both self-report information combined with hospital admission information provides a unique opportunity in a large cohort to investigate possible gout definitions and their influence on \gls{gwas}.


### Genetic associations for gout in Polynesian populations

As has been previously mentioned (sections \@ref(goutMetSyn), \@ref(chap4Intro)), New Zealand Polynesians have a higher prevalence of a gout and metabolic disease [@Winnard2013]. Of the 28 genetic variants associated with serum urate levels that have been previously reported in European populations, 17 also had significant associations with gout [@Kottgen2013]. In the Polynesian populations of New Zealand, XXX have replicated the association with gout, with some Polynesian specific effects being noted [@Phipps-Green2016]. The inherent higher prevalence of gout in Polynesian populations but lack of adequate sample sizes to perform \gls{gwas} with sufficient power to detect loci, other than the main effect loci of _ABCG2_ and _SLC2A9_, means that extra approaches are needed to find additional evidence to reduce the number of false negative results.


### Use of selection statistics to inform GWAS

\gls{gwas} in the last few years have required to have larger and larger cohorts, in a quest to discover the source of 'missing heritability' [@Visscher2012;@Yang2017]. The requirement for larger cohorts comes from the inverse relationship between effect-size and statistical power. The source of missing heritability is thought to be found in the polygenic effects of many small effect genetic variants [@Spencer2009]. \gls{gwas} also suffer from the need to control the false positive rate and as such have a stringent association significance threshold [@Fadista2016]. One of the side-effects of this threshold is that variants that have a true effect but due to cohort size do not reach statistical significance are lost in the 'noise' of the \gls{gwas} signal. One of the possibilities to be able to identify such variants is to use methodologies that capture the non-additive genetic variance and pair this with the \gls{gwas}. The use of selection statistics in combination with \gls{gwas} is one of these methodologies that can be applied to prioritise \gls{gwas} results [@Ayodo2007].

### Objectives

- Test performance of gout definitions on \gls{gwas}
- Investigate the use of selection statistics in conjunction with \gls{gwas}

## Methods

### European Gout GWAS {#ukbbgwas}

<!-- acr report using unfiltered controls -->
This \gls{gwas} was performed using the interim data release from the UK Biobank (approval number 12611) downloaded November 2015. There was genetic information for `r NROW(fam)` individuals. For the \gls{gwas} itself, it was limited to be only people who had self reported an ethnic background of British, Irish, or 'any other white background'.

Inclusion criteria were European ethnicity, aged between 40 and 69 years and had genome wide genotypes available. The exclusion criteria used was: mismatch between self-reported sex and genetic sex, genotype quality control failure, relatedness, or either a primary or secondary hospital diagnosis of kidney disease (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes I12, I13, N00-N05, N07, N11, N14, N17â€“N19, Q61, N25.0, Z49, Z94.0, Z99.2), participants aged 70 years and over, and those with kidney disease, because these are risk factors for secondary gout.

Individuals from the UK Biobank cohort were genotyped on an Axiom array with 820,967 markers (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The genotypes were phased using SHAPEIT3, and then imputed using IMPUTE2 with both the UK10K impute reference panel^[https://www.uk10k.org], and the haplotype reference consortium impute panel [@McCarthy2016], to bring the total number of \glspl{snp} to approximately 73.3 million. Genotyping, phasing, and imputation were performed by the UK Biobank.

#### Gout definitions

There were four main classification criteria that were used to define gout cases. _Hospital defined gout_ involved either a primary or secondary hospital diagnosis for gout (ICD-10 code M10, including sub-codes). _Self-report of gout_ was defined as reporting having gout at the time of the study interview. _Use of \gls{ult}_ used self-report data for the use of allopurinol, febuxostat, or sulphinpyrazone, and not having a hospital diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (ICD-10 codes C81-C96). _Winnard defined gout_ was based on @Winnard2012 and consisted of a hospital diagnosis of gout, or self report of gout specific medication (\gls{ult} or colchicine). The largest number of people were classified through either self-report or the use of urate lowering therapy (Figure \@ref(fig:ukbbupsetplot)). Additional exclusion criteria were applied to participants not classified as having gout from these definitions. The criteria were cortico-steroidal use, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or probenicid use. 

Confidence intervals for proportions were calculated using the \texttt{prop.test} function from the _stats_ package in R.

```



#### Gout association test

A \gls{gwas} was performed using logistic regression in Plink1.9b [@plink2; @Chang2015] for each gout classification, with age, sex, and \gls{bmi} as co-variates. The association results for each \gls{gwas} were then compared with the 30 \glspl{snp} reported in Table 1 of @Kottgen2013 that had previously been associated with urate and gout in a cohort of >140,000 Europeans. 


#### Heriabililty

For each gout classification, the genetic component of heritability explained was calculated. This was done by first randomly selected 10,000 controls and then combining this same subset with cases from each of the gout classifications. The genetic variance was calculated for each chromosome separately and then combined. The dichotomous case-control phenotype was transformed onto a continuous liability scale using the restricted maximum likelihood analysis using GCTA (v1.26.0, @Yang2011part) and a general population prevalence of gout of 2% (section \@ref(gctaHeritability)). The liability scale operates on a liability threshold model whereby an unseen continuous trait has a threshold above which one is a case [@Lee2011; @Zuk2012]. Heritability estimates were compared using the formula h~1~ - h~2~ and the SE calculated using formula \@ref(eq:h2se).


\begin{equation} 
 SE = \sqrt{SE_1^2 + SE_2^2}
 (\#eq:h2se)
\end{equation} 

### Polynesian Gout GWAS

A multi-cohort gout dataset was assembled by combining individuals from the Genetics of Gout, Diabetes, and Kidney Disease in Aotearoa cohorts and the Ngati Porou Hauora Charitable Trust cohort. Genotyping on the Inifinium CoreExome v24 bead-chip was performed at the University of Queensland (Centre for Clinical Genomics) for the Genetics of Gout, Diabetes, and Kidney Disease in Aotearoa cohorts and at AgResearch (Invermay Agricultural Centre) for the Ngati Porou Hauora Charitable Trust cohort. The genotype quality control procedures as described in section \@ref(coreExomeQC) were applied per cohort, and then as necessary after combining the cohorts. The genotype quality control, and combining of cohorts was performed by Dr Tanya Major, Merriman Lab. \Glsdesc{pca} was performed on the combined dataset with the first 10 components outputted and used as covariates to adjust for population substructure in the \gls{gwas}.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
poly_fam <- read_delim('~/data/PolyGwas/QC1_7-FullMerge1.0and1.1_ExDup_MattBrown_Czech-plus_polygoutAff.fam', delim = '\t', col_names = FALSE)
poly_phenos <- read_delim('~/data/PolyGwas/coreEx_phenos021216.txt', delim = '\t') %>% select(SUBJECT, AGECOL, SEX, BMI, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, ETHCLASS, ETH_SUM, POLYETHCLASS)
```


The \gls{gwas} was performed for gout using individuals with Polynesian ancestry. Gout affection was determined by the \gls{acr} criteria [@Wallace1977a], or a doctor diagnosis, or enrolled in a gout drug trial. All participants were older than 18, and provided informed written consent. Exclusion criteria included unknown gout affection status, non-Polynesian self-reported ancestry, or a mismatch between self-report ancestry and \gls{pca} clustering. The \gls{gwas} was adjusted for age, sex, and the first ten \glspl{pc} calculated from 2,858 ancestry informative markers (as identified by Illumina). Markers were removed if the minor allele frequency was less than 0.01, or had an \gls{hwe} chi-squared exact test P > 1x10^-6^. The \gls{gwas} was conducted by Dr Tanya Major(Merriman Lab) using Plink v1.9b32.


<!-- polynesian_gout-affection.pheno -->
<!--     - gout either ACR criteria or GP diagnosed / in a gout drug trial (only 119 not ACR) -->
<!--     - excluded unknown gout status, non-polynesian (either self-report or PCA mismatch), and people <18 years old -->






## Results

### UK Biobank

#### Particpant and association model characteristics

There was genome-wide genotype data for 105,421 participants, after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean \gls{bmi} for all participants was `r ukbio_gout %>%ungroup() %>%  summarise(bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% pull(bmi) %>% round(., 2)` kg/m^2^, the mean age was `r ukbio_gout %>%ungroup() %>% summarise(age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% pull(age) %>% round(., 2)` years, and `r ukbio_gout %>%ungroup() %>% summarise(percent_male = (1 - sum(sex)/NROW(.)) *100) %>% pull(percent_male) %>% round(., 2)`% were male. A breakdown of by affection status for anthropomorphic traits, drug use, and gout classifications is in Table \@ref(tab:ukbbclin).

Prior to performing the \glspl{gwas} using the different classifications for gout, the best model (determined by \gls{aic}) for phenotype co-variate adjustment was determined by logistic regression. Known co-variates for gout included age, sex, and \gls{bmi}. Each of these co-variates were tested individually and together. Each covariate had a significant of association on their own: age (P = \num{`r broom::tidy(models[[1]]$model) %>% filter(term == 'age') %>% .[['p.value']] %>% format(., scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)`}), sex (P = \num{`r broom::tidy(models[[2]]$model) %>% filter(term == 'sex_factormale') %>% .[['p.value']] %>% format(., scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)`}), and \gls{bmi} (P = \num{`r broom::tidy(models[[4]]$model) %>% filter(term == 'bmi') %>% .[['p.value']] %>% format(., scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)`}). In the combined model, with all three covariates there was an \gls{aic} for the model of 19558.30 compared to models with each with age (\gls{aic} 22706.05), sex (\gls{aic} 21041.80) and \gls{bmi} (\gls{aic} 22001.03). Based on the \gls{aic} for the combined model, age, sex, and \gls{bmi} were used as the covariates in the \gls{gwas} for gout.

```

#### Performance of classification

There were a total of `r ukbb_n$n_gout` individuals that had any classification of gout and `r ukbb_n$n_controls` controls. Of those with any classification of gout, there were `r ukbb_n$n_hosp` with a hospital diagnosis, `r ukbb_n$n_ult` with urate lowering therapy, `r ukbb_n$n_winnard` with the Winnard criteria, and `r ukbb_n$n_self` with self-reported gout. The overlaps in classification between each group can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:ukbbupsetplot). There was considerable overlap between the self-report, urate lowering therapy, and Winnard classifications with 1242 individuals meeting all three classifications. There were 571 (27.6%) of 2066 participants who could only be defined through self-report. And for hospital diagnosis, 126 (33.0%) of 382, did not meet the self-report of gout, or \gls{ult} use definition criteria.


The prevalence of gout from all definitions was `r round(ukbb_n$n_gout/ukbb_n$n_control *100,1)`%, this ranged from the lowest prevalence of gout of 0.36%, from the hospital diagnosis definition, through to the highest of 2.18%, by self-report of gout or \gls{ult} usage in the study population (Table \@ref(tab:ukbbprev)).

Analysis of the 30 reported urate associated \glspl{snp} from @Kottgen2013 revealed similar odds ratios for all gout definitions (Figure \@ref(fig:kotplot), Table \@ref(tab:ukbbkot)). Experiment wide significance was defined as P < `r as.character(signif(0.005/30,2))`, and genome-wide significance as P < 5x10^-8^. There were differing numbers of \glspl{snp} that had a significant association with gout, both at genome and the experiment-wide thresholds between the gout definitions used. Meeting genome-wide significance, there were five \glspl{snp} (_ABCG2_, _GCKR_, _SLC17A3_, _SLC22A12_, and _SLC2A9_) for both the self-reported gout or \gls{ult} usage definition and the self-reported gout definition, four \glspl{snp} (_ABCG2_, _GCKR_, _SLC22A12_, and _SLC2A9_) for the \gls{ult} usage definition, three \glspl{snp} (_ABCG2_, _GCKR_, and _SLC2A9_) for the Winnard definition, and two \glspl{snp} (_ABCG2_ and _SLC2A9_) for the hospital diagnosis definition. For all definitions, the effect size and strength of association was larger for _ABCG2_ than _SLC2A9_. At the experiment-wide significance threshold, there were 13 \glspl{snp} for the self-reported gout or \gls{ult} use definition, 12 \glspl{snp} for the self-reported gout definition, 11 for \gls{ult} use definition, 10 for the Winnard definition, and three \glspl{snp} for the hospital diagnosis definition.

#### Heritability Explained

To see if there was a difference between gout classifications in the genetic component of the variance explained by an additive model in gout, heritability estimates were calculated for each gout classification. To do this, 10000 controls were randomly selected and were used with each different gout criteria and heritability estimates for each chromosome were calculated using GCTA 1.26.0 [@Yang2011; @Yang2011part]. The heritability estimates were 0.289 (SE 0.034) for the self-report of gout or ULT use definition, 0.283 (SE 0.036) for the self-report of gout definition, 0.282 (SE 0.040) for the Winnard definition, 0.308 (SE 0.044) for the ULT use definition and 0.236 (SE 0.160) for the hospital diagnosis definition. There were no statistically significant differences between the heritability estimates of any of the different classifications. The heritability estimates were similar to the estimates of genetic variance of serum urate [@Kottgen2013].




<!-- Kottgen refs 10-12 put heritability explained for serum urate at 40-70%. Kottgen reported heritability explained in serum urate loci that were adjusted for age and sex from 0.27 to 0.41. -->

#### UK Biobank gout defintions GWAS

The total number of genome-wide significant \glspl{snp} was `r nom_snps$hosp %>% length()` for the hospital definition, `r nom_snps$self %>% length()` for the self-reported gout definition, `r nom_snps$ult %>% length()` for the \gls{ult} use definition, `r nom_snps$winnard %>% length()` for the Winnard definition, and `r nom_snps$selfult %>% length()` for the self-reported gout or \gls{ult} use definition. There was considerable overlap between the definitions in the \glspl{snp} that met the nominal significance threshold of P < 1x10^-5^ (Figure \@ref(fig:ukOverlap)). There were five main regions of the genome that had peaks of association with gout. These were at _GCKR_ on chromosome 2, _SLC2A9_ and _ABCG2_ on chromosome 4, the _SLC17A1-SLC17A3_ region on chromosome 6, and the _SLC22A11-SLC22A12_ region on chromosome 11 (Figure \@ref(fig:manhatSelfUltAgeSexBmi)). Only the peaks at _SLC2A9_ and _ABCG2_ reached genome-wide significance in the hospital definition.

There were a total of ten top \glspl{snp} from seven genes that were associated with gout at a genome-wide significance threshold, across the definitions used (Table \@ref(tab:ukgwas)). The top \gls{snp} for each locus differed between definitions for _GCKR_ and _SLC2A9_, and _SLC22A12_. _GCKR_ had the top \gls{snp} for self-report of gout, self-report of gout or \gls{ult} use, or \gls{ult} use all had the top \gls{snp} as rs780093, whereas the top \gls{snp} for the Winnard definition was rs780094. The top \gls{snp} was rs9994216 in _SLC2A9_ for the self-reported gout definition, and rs4697701 for the \gls{ult} usage, self-report of gout, and the Winnard definitions. _SLC22A12_ had rs11231837 for the top \gls{snp} for the self-reported gout and self-reported gout or \gls{ult} use definitions, whereas, rs7929627 was the top \gls{snp} for the \gls{ult} usage, and Winnard definitions. None of the top \glspl{snp} were the same as reported by @Kottgen2013 in Table 1.

The reason for the difference in the reported top \glspl{snp} is due to minor differences in genotyping rates between the \glspl{snp}. Another reason that explains the difference, is the @Kottgen2013 \glspl{snp} were reported based on association with urate levels, as opposed to gout, where the top \gls{snp} differed between definitions this again can be attributed to genotyping rates. In the case of _GCKR_ and _SLC22A12_ the variants were in complete \gls{ld} but had minutely different genotyping rates. In the case of _ABCG2_ and _SLC17A3_ the reported variants were in complete \gls{ld} with the reported corresponding @Kottgen2013 \gls{snp}. The effect sizes were all extremely similar and consistent with the lead \glspl{snp} that were previously reported.

### Comparison of haplotypic selection with gout \gls{gwas} 

In order to determine if additional loci, that didn't meet the significance threshold in \gls{gwas}, had additional information from the selection tests that could prioritise the \gls{gwas} results, the combinations of the gout \gls{gwas} and selection results were created. The European ancestry combination, combined the \gls{gwas} performed in the UK Biobank using the self-reported gout or \gls{ult} usage with the haplotypic selection results for the \gls{gbr} population. The Polynesian ancestry combination, combined the Polynesian gout \gls{gwas} with the haplotypic selection results for the Polynesian populations of \gls{cim}, \gls{nzm}, \gls{sam}, and \gls{ton}. All of the results were refined to the markers of the CoreExome \gls{snp} array. A new threshold for the combinations was used that required an |\gls{ihs}| or |\gls{nsl}| > 2 and a \gls{gwas} P < 2 x 10^-4^. Given that |\gls{ihs}| or |\gls{nsl}| > 2 is approximately equivalent to P = 0.05, the combined threshold, if the selection statistics and \gls{gwas} were independent would be P = 5 x 10^-8^.

When the results from the UK Biobank \gls{gwas} for gout, using the self-reported gout or \gls{ult} usage definition and the \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} results for the \gls{gbr} population were combined, there was only one \gls{snp}, rs12638016, with an |\gls{ihs}| > 2.6 (equivalent to the extreme most 1%) that also had P < 10^-5^ in the \gls{gwas}. If the significance threshold for \gls{ihs} was reduced to |\gls{ihs}| > 2 (approximately the 5% extreme most values), then there were three \glspl{snp}, all located at _SLC22A12_ or within 1 kb, that were genome-wide significant in the \gls{gwas} (rs505802, rs9734313, and rs559946), and four \glspl{snp} that were nominally significant. There were `r ukbb_p05_ihs2 %>% filter(abs(statvalue) > 2.0, P< 0.01) %>% NROW()` \glspl{snp} that had an |\gls{ihs}| > 2 and in the gout \gls{gwas} P < 0.01, this decreased to `r ukbb_p05_ihs2 %>% filter(abs(statvalue) > 2.0, P< 2e-4) %>% NROW() %>% num_to_word()`, with a \gls{gwas} P threshold of 2 x 10^-4^ (Table \@ref(tab:haplogwas)).

Using a threshold of an |\gls{nsl}| > 2 and a nominally significant P < 10^-5^, there were two \glspl{snp}, both on chromosome 6 (Table \@ref(tab:haplogwas)). The first was rs4712972 and was located in _SLC17A4._ The second was rs501220 and was located in _SLC17A3_. If the thresholds were relaxed, there were `r ukbb_p05_nsl2 %>% filter(abs(statvalue) > 2.0, P< 0.01) %>% NROW()` \glspl{snp} that had an |\gls{nsl}| > 2 and in the gout \gls{gwas} P < 0.01, this decreased to `r ukbb_p05_nsl2 %>% filter(abs(statvalue) > 2.0, P< 2e-4) %>% NROW() %>% num_to_word()`, with a \gls{gwas} P threshold of 2 x 10^-4^ (Table \@ref(tab:haplogwas)).

Combining the results of the \gls{gwas} for gout in Polynesians with the \gls{ihs} had a single marker that met the threshold of |\gls{ihs}| > 2.6 and a \gls{gwas} P < 5 x 10^-8^, that \gls{snp} was rs2725215, located in _PKD2._ Rs2725215 also had a |\gls{nsl}| > 2.6. There were `r poly_p05_ihs2 %>% spread(pop, statvalue)%>%  NROW()` \glspl{snp} that had a \gls{gwas} P < 0.05 and an |\gls{ihs}| > 2, this reduced to `r polyhaplogwas %>% filter(statid == 26) %>% NROW()` at the combined threshold of |\gls{ihs}| > 2 and P < 2 x 10^-4^ (Table \@ref(tab:polyhaplogwas)).

At the combined threshold of |\gls{ihs}| or |\gls{nsl}| > 2 and a \gls{gwas} P < 2 x 10^-4^, there were seven \glspl{snp} that were in _IBSP_, _PKD2_, _ABCG2_ and _PPCDC_, found with both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} (Table \@ref(tab:polyhaplogwas)). _CHN2/CPVL_ and _SLC39A11_ only had \glspl{snp} with \gls{nsl}. Out of all of the \glspl{snp} that met the combined threshold, ten \glspl{snp} has evidence from both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}. Rs12908919 (PPCDC) was the only \gls{snp} that had multiple populations (\gls{sam} and \gls{ton}) and evidence from both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl} (Table \@ref(tab:polyhaplogwas)), whereas, there were six \glspl{snp} that only had evidence from only the \gls{ton} population from both \gls{ihs} and \gls{nsl}.

### GWAS results



<!-- > _ukbio paper_: Accurate and consistent definitions of the case and control states is important to have the maximise power for case-control cohort studies. Consistency of definition also provides better replication of association across differing cohorts [\@ref]. The analysis of the UK Biobank data showed that the self-report of gout or \gls{ult} use definition had the highest number of gout cases, and the best precision from the definitions used, for association with gout. These findings are consistent with the recent SUGAR study -->


> UKBB paper discussion

The UK Biobank had a larger number of cases for the gout \gls{gwas} than @Kottgen2013. This increase in cases reflects the increase in strength of association that was seen. In the SUGAR paper [@Dalbeth2016], the definition that provided the highest specificity (82%) and sensitivity (72%) was self-reported gout or on \gls{ult} when tested against the mono-sodium urate crystal identification as the gold standard. Consistent with this, this study found that the self-report of gout or \gls{ult} use definition also provided the highest precision from the definitions used, and supports the use of this definition when better gout classification methods are not available, such as \gls{acr} or mono-sodium urate crystal identification.

The different definitions of gout used in this study may represent the different disease presentations or patient populations. Not all patients were captured by all criteria, and the Winnard definition was not as good as self-report of gout or \gls{ult}, despite a similarity in definitions, and also had lower precision in the genetic association. The hospital diagnosis definition had the lowest prevalence and was restrictive, making it the least likely to capture most people with gout. One third of the people that met this definition did not meet any of the self-report definitions, both of gout, and/or \gls{ult} usage. There are a few reasons that might explain this, first the hospitalised population may have a different disease presentation from those in the community identified by self-report or \gls{ult} use. Secondly, a diagnosis of gout made in a hospital my subsequently be revised to a different diagnosis, this is not taken into account with the current methodology. Therefore, when self report information is available it is recommended that the self-report of gout or \gls{ult} use be used as the definition to define cases.

Each of the gout definitions tested had genome-wide significance for \glspl{snp} associated with gout in _ABCG2_ and _SLC2A9_. These two genes encode proteins that transport urate in the gut (ABCG2) and proximal tubule of the kidney (SLC2A9). The large effect sizes in the association with gout, show similarity with their large effect sizes in the control of serum urate levels [@Kottgen2013].

Heritability estimates for the variance attributed to the additive effects of common \glspl{snp} of 0.282-0.308 (excluding the hospital definition) were in line with those reported by @Kottgen2013, with the same approach using the GCTA software of 0.27 to 0.41 for serum urate levels. The comparability between the heritability estimates for gout and serum urate by common genetic variants suggests the genetic heritabilities of serum urate levels and gout is similar. However, also contributing to the risk of gout are environmental factors, such as diet and medications. Because the estimates are constructed under an additive model, it does not take into account the non-additive variance, such as gene-gene or gene-environment interactions, or the effect of structural variants such as copy number variations.

- the gwas is also very similar to that which was done as part of the phenome-wide gwas

<!-- - all definitions tested abcg2/slc2a9 were genome-wide significant -->
<!-- - large effect sizes -> effect sizes in GWAS of control of SU levels - consistent with their role in regulation of SU and gout risk -->
<!-- - heritability estimates for variance explained by all common snps 0.282-0.308 (ex hospital def) -->
<!-- - within the range from kottgen (0.27-0.41) and they also calculated using GCTA for SU -->
<!-- - estimates of variance explained in european by common snps are comparable, suggesting that the common genetic variant-mediated heritabilities of SU and gout are similar -->
<!-- - diet, medications and other environmental factors contribute to risk of gout -->
<!-- - heritabilities are estimated under an additive model, so don't include non-additive variance (GxG and GxE), rare variants, CNV -->
- limited to European -> might not translate to other populations
- limited in that no gold-standard available to determine FPR/FNR


----


Poly gwas

ABCG2 is the usual contender, the other variant rs11034401is an intergenic variant on chr11

- talk about rs2231142 a little and why it is the main gout result

the polynesian gwas is largely underpowered

### Heritability explained

The heritability explained under an additive model for gout was similar to that which was reported for serum urate by @Kottgen2013. There were no statistically significant differences between the classifications. This could come down to the number of cases for each classification 

### GWAS and selection

There was limited selection for gout and urate associated loci in the \gls{gbr} population

polynesian gwas and selection in wp, PPCDC has something to do with malaria "oocyst development and the production of sporozoites" - https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-016-1860-3

lbsp has soemthing to do with bones and urate? http://ard.bmj.com.ezproxy.otago.ac.nz/content/70/9/1684.long



### Limitations

- computationally the grm takes a lot of resources, hence only using 10000 controls, and not the full dataset
- the differences between the gwases for the ukbiobank are likely a numbers issue
- poly gwas
    - the lack of power -> samplesize
    - data set wasn't imputed
    - imputation of the Polynesian data is difficult, lack of reference haplotypes
    
- Poly selection/gwas
    - the selection results could be because of higher than general population prevalenvce of gout in the cohort
    - reduced markers used

- EUR selection/gwas
    - the greatly reduced number of markers because the selection results were calculated in the coreexome markers


> Maybe bring up the current discussion about the gcta for the use of heritability versus ldak?

<!-- TANYA -->

<!-- Whole-genome principal component analysis vectors were calculated using a subset of 2,858 ancestry informative markers (as identified by Illumina) extracted from the CoreExome whole-genome genotypes. The SmartPCA (EIGENSOFT v6.0.1) [25]) program was used to perform this prinicipal component analysis, with an output of 10 eigenvectors, no outlier removal, and no population size limit. Individuals of non-Polynesian ancestry were included in the analysis group, and the first four vectors plotted against each other to view the clustering of ancestral groupings (Asian, European, Eastern Polynesian, and Western Polynesian). The first four vectors were chosen for inclusion as covariates in the linear regression to account for population stratification and cryptic relatedness, which may cause confounding. -->
<!-- The Illumina Infinium CoreExome v24 bead chip platform was used to genotype participants for ~500,000 variants across the whole-genome. Genotyping was performed at the University of Queensland (Centre for Clinical Genomics) for the Genetics of Gout, Diabetes, and Kidney Disease in Aotearoa cohorts and at AgResearch (Invermay Agricultural Centre) for the Ngati Porou Hauora Charitable Trust cohort. Bead chip genotyping batches were auto-clustered using GenomeStudio v2011.1 software (Illumina, San Diego). The Illumina GenomeStudio best practice guidelines and quality control protocols of Guo et al. (2014) were applied to these auto-clustered genotypes to ensure final genotype calls were of the highest possible quality [23, 24]. After the initial quality control protocols were applied the genotyping batches were merged and relevant quality control steps repeated in the full dataset. -->
