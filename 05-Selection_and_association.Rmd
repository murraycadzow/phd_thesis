# Selection and Association Studies

objectives:
The objectives for this chapter are to:
- Determine the improvement (if any) of genotype imputation in Polynesians from incorporating Polynesian haplotypes into the imputatation reference panel
- Investigate if there is a correlation between selection statistics and variance GWAS
- Implement a 'meta-analysis' of selection statistics, GWAS, and vGWAS results

Selection, vGwAS, GWAS, and Imputation of Polynesian Populations



## European GWAS, vGWAS and Selection

This section describes the gout GWAS and vGWAS performed in the UKBiobank data and the comparision with the results from the selection analysis in the 1000 Genomes Project data.

### European Gout GWAS

Prior to conducting the GWAS for gout, phenotypic models were assessed. Logisitic regression was and the Akaike information criterion for each model was used for model selection. The covariates used included: age, sex, BMI, waist, waist to height ratio, and waist to hip ratio. Each covariate was significant (P < 0.05) on their own.


- GWAS results
- Heritability explained

#### GWAS results

The top SNPs from the GWAS were:

- hosp
- self
- self + ULT
- ULT
- all

manhattan plot for the all \@ref(fig:manhatAllAgeSex)

(ref:manhatAllAgeSex) _Manhattan plot for Gout GWAS adjusted for age and sex_

```{r manhatAllAgeSex, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:manhatAllAgeSex)', fig.width=7, fig.asp=1, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/05_selection_and_association/all_age_sex.png')
```


```{r, engine='block', eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, include=FALSE }
For this section I want to compare the results for each of the gwases and see if the same 
snps come out and perhaps in the same order.

Also want to compare the results from the age+sex adjusted versus the results from the age+sex+waist+waist:height
```

<!---
ALL GROUP: the most significant snps are from ABCG2. SLC2A9 also features highly. The majority of the significant snps are from these two genes.

#### Heritability Explained

```{r, engine='block', eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, include=FALSE }
here I want to include the results from the heritability analysis across the different criteria
